## 1. Will Requirements

### Statutory Basis
Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 190B (Uniform Probate Code)

### Execution Requirements (MGL c. 190B, § 2-502)
- Testator must be 18+ years old
- Testator must be of sound mind
- Will must be in writing
- Will must be signed by testator (or by another at testator's direction in testator's presence)
- Will must be signed by at least **2 witnesses**
- Witnesses must sign within reasonable time after witnessing testator's signature or acknowledgment

### Witness Requirements
- Witnesses must be "generally competent" (not required to be disinterested)
- Beneficial interest does not invalidate will but may void the bequest to that witness (MGL c. 190B, § 2-505)
- Best practice: Use disinterested witnesses

### Self-Proving Affidavit (MGL c. 190B, § 2-504)
- Optional but strongly recommended
- Signed by testator and witnesses before notary
- Eliminates need for witness testimony at probate
- **Flag if missing**: Not fatal but creates administrative burden

### Common Execution Defects to Flag
- Missing witness signatures
- Witness signed before testator
- Only one witness
- No attestation clause
- Testator initials only (no full signature)
- Undated document
- Alterations without proper re-execution

## 2. Trust Requirements

### Revocable Living Trusts
- No statutory execution requirements in MA

### Irrevocable Trusts
- Same as revocable trusts
- Additional scrutiny for:
  - Grantor retained interests
  - Powers of appointment
  - Trustee powers and limitations

### Trust Funding Issues to Flag
- Trust referenced but no evidence of funding
- Real estate not deeded to trust
- Bank/investment accounts not titled to trust
- Retirement accounts naming trust as beneficiary (tax implications)
- Pour-over will without corresponding trust

### Trustee Provisions to Review

## 6. Elective Share Rules

### Statutory Basis
MGL c. 190B, § 2-201 et seq.

### Surviving Spouse Rights
- Surviving spouse may elect to take elective share instead of bequest under will
- Elective share amount varies based on length of marriage and other factors
- Generally approximates what spouse would receive in intestacy

### Planning Considerations
