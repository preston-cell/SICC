## 1. MassHealth Overview

### What is MassHealth Long-Term Care?
MassHealth (Massachusetts Medicaid) covers long-term care costs including:
- Nursing home care
- Home and community-based services
- Adult day health programs

### Why Plan for MassHealth?
- Nursing home costs: $12,000-$15,000+/month in MA
- Medicare does not cover long-term custodial care
- Private long-term care insurance increasingly expensive/unavailable
- Without planning, assets depleted before Medicaid kicks in

### Planning Timeline
- **Best**: 5+ years before potential need
- **Acceptable**: Any time before crisis
- **Crisis**: Limited options but some strategies still available

---

## 2. Eligibility Requirements

### Financial Requirements
1. **Income Limit**: 
   - Most income goes to nursing home (patient pay amount)
   - Personal needs allowance retained (~$72.80/month)
   - No strict income limit for nursing home care if income goes to facility

2. **Asset Limit**: 
   - Individual: $2,000 in countable assets
   - Married (one spouse in facility): Community spouse resource allowance (CSRA)
   - CSRA: ~$154,000 maximum (2024, verify current)

### Non-Financial Requirements
- Massachusetts resident
- U.S. citizen or qualified immigrant
- Require nursing facility level of care

---

## 3. Asset Limits and Countable Assets

### Countable Assets (Must Spend Down)
- Bank accounts (checking, savings)
- Investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds)
- Retirement accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s)
- Cash value life insurance (over $1,500)
- Real estate (other than primary residence)
- Vehicles (beyond one)
- Trusts with accessible assets

### Exempt Assets (Not Counted)
- Primary residence (with equity limit ~$1,071,000)
  - Must intend to return OR
  - Spouse/dependent child/disabled child residing
- One vehicle
- Personal belongings and household goods
- Prepaid funeral and burial expenses (irrevocable)
- Term life insurance (no cash value)
- Certain annuities (Medicaid-compliant)

### Assets to Flag in Analysis
- [ ] High home equity (near or over limit)
- [ ] Multiple vehicles
- [ ] Cash value life insurance
- [ ] Non-exempt real estate
- [ ] Accessible trust assets
- [ ] Large retirement accounts

---

## 4. 5-Year Look-Back Period

### How It Works
- MassHealth reviews all asset transfers for 5 years before application
- Transfers for less than fair market value trigger penalty period
- Penalty = value transferred ÷ average monthly nursing home cost (~$13,000+)

### Example
```
$130,000 transferred to children 3 years before application
Penalty: $130,000 ÷ $13,000 = 10-month penalty period
During penalty: Applicant ineligible for MassHealth coverage
```

### Transfers to Review in Estate Documents

**Flag these if within 5 years or planned**:
- Gifts to children or family
- Property transfers
- Trust funding (certain trusts)
- Adding names to accounts or deeds
- Below-market sales

### Exempt Transfers (No Penalty)
- Transfers to spouse
- Transfers to blind or disabled child
- Transfers to trust for sole benefit of disabled person under 65
- Transfer of home to:
  - Spouse
  - Child under 21
  - Child who is blind/disabled
  - Sibling with equity interest who lived there 1+ year
  - Caretaker child who lived there 2+ years and provided care

**Flag if**: Recent transfers that don't meet exemptions

---

## 5. Irrevocable Trust Requirements

### Why Irrevocable Trusts?
- Assets in properly structured irrevocable trust not countable after 5 years
- Protects assets while allowing some benefits to grantor
- Must be done 5+ years before MassHealth application

### Requirements for Asset Protection

**Trust MUST be**:
1. **Irrevocable**: Grantor cannot revoke, amend, or terminate
2. **Properly structured**: See provisions below
3. **5+ years old**: At time of MassHealth application

**Trust MUST NOT give grantor access to**:
- Principal (corpus)
- Right to demand distributions
- Power to change beneficiaries
- Power to revoke or amend

### Acceptable Trust Provisions
- Income distributions to grantor (income-only trust)
- Trustee discretion over income (not principal)
- Limited power of appointment (non-general)
- Remainder to family members

### Problematic Trust Provisions to Flag

**These make trust assets COUNTABLE**:
- [ ] Grantor can revoke or amend
- [ ] Grantor can access principal
- [ ] Grantor can direct distributions
- [ ] Grantor can change beneficiaries (general POA)
- [ ] Trust requires distributions for "health, maintenance, support"
- [ ] Trustee must distribute for grantor's "needs"
- [ ] Any language giving grantor control over principal

### Revocable Trusts and MassHealth
- Revocable trust assets are 100% countable
- No asset protection benefit
- Revocable trusts are for probate avoidance, not Medicaid planning

**Flag if**: Revocable trust being relied on for asset protection

---

## 6. Asset Protection Strategies

### Irrevocable Income-Only Trust
**Structure**:
- Assets transferred to irrevocable trust
- Grantor can receive income only
- Principal locked up for remainder beneficiaries

**Benefits**:
- Assets protected after 5 years
- Grantor receives investment income
- Principal passes to family at death

**Considerations**:
- Loss of access to principal
- Loss of step-up in basis (potentially)
- 5-year waiting period

### Life Estate with Remainder Interest
**Structure**:
- Transfer home but retain right to live there for life
- Remainder interest to children

**Benefits**:
- Protects home value (discounted) after 5 years
- Can continue living in home
- Simpler than trust

**Risks**:
- Cannot sell without remaindermen consent
- If forced to leave (nursing home), life estate ends
- Caretaker child exception may be lost

### Medicaid-Compliant Annuity
**Structure**:
- Convert countable assets to income stream
- Annuity must meet specific requirements

**Requirements**:
- Irrevocable
- Non-transferable
- Actuarially sound (based on life expectancy)
- Equal payments, no balloon
- Names MassHealth as beneficiary (to extent of benefits paid)

**Use**: Crisis planning when 5-year look-back cannot be completed

### Personal Service Contract
**Structure**:
- Agreement to pay family member for care
- Payment is for services, not a gift

**Requirements**:
- Written contract
- Fair market value for services
- Documented care provided
- Contract must be contemporaneous

**Use**: Crisis planning, converting assets to income for caregiver

---

## 7. Spousal Protections

### Community Spouse Resource Allowance (CSRA)
- Healthy spouse ("community spouse") can keep assets up to CSRA
- 2024 CSRA maximum: ~$154,000 (verify current)
- Minimum: ~$30,000

### CSRA Calculation
- Total countable assets divided in half
- Community spouse keeps half up to maximum
- Institutionalized spouse must spend down to $2,000

### Monthly Maintenance Needs Allowance (MMNA)
- Community spouse entitled to minimum monthly income
- If community spouse income below MMNA, can shift income from institutionalized spouse
- 2024 MMNA: ~$3,900/month maximum

### Spousal Refusal
- Spouse can refuse to make assets available
- MassHealth may seek support from refusing spouse
- Strategy requires legal guidance

### Strategies for Married Couples
- Maximize CSRA at snapshot date
- Convert countable to exempt assets (home improvements, vehicle, prepaid burial)
- Consider spousal annuity
- Caretaker child exception for home

**Flag if**: Married couple without spousal protection planning

---

## 8. Estate Recovery

### What is Estate Recovery?
- MassHealth seeks reimbursement from deceased recipient's estate
- Applies to probate estate and certain trust assets
- Can claim against former home

### What's Subject to Recovery?
- Probate assets
- Trust assets (certain trusts)
- Life estate remainder (potentially)
- Joint accounts (at death)

### Protections
- No recovery while surviving spouse alive
- No recovery if surviving child under 21
- No recovery if blind or disabled child
- Home protected while surviving spouse/dependent living there

### Planning to Minimize Recovery
- Proper irrevocable trust (assets not in probate estate)
- Transfer assets before death (with planning)
- Exhaust assets before death (spend on care, family)

**Flag if**: Estate plan doesn't consider MassHealth recovery
