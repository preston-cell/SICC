## 1. Massachusetts Estate Tax Overview

### Key Facts (Verify Current Rates Before Analysis)
- **Threshold**: $2,000,000 (one of lowest in nation)
- **Cliff Effect**: Once estate exceeds $2M, ENTIRE estate is taxed (not just excess)
- **Rates**: Graduated from 0.8% to 16%
- **No portability**: Unlike federal, unused exemption cannot transfer to surviving spouse

### Cliff Effect Illustration
- Estate of $1,999,999 = $0 MA tax
- Estate of $2,000,001 = ~$99,600 MA tax
- This creates planning opportunities to reduce estate below threshold

### What's Included in MA Estate
- All property owned at death
- Life insurance on decedent's life (if owned by decedent)
- Retirement accounts
- Joint property (decedent's share)
- Trust property over which decedent had control
- Property transferred within 3 years of death (certain transfers)

## 2. Federal Estate Tax Overview

### Key Facts (Verify Current Rates Before Analysis)
- **Exemption**: Currently ~$13 million per person (inflation-adjusted annually)
- **Portability**: Unused exemption can transfer to surviving spouse
- **Top Rate**: 40%
- **Sunset**: Exemption may revert to ~$6 million after 2025 (verify current status)

### Federal-MA Coordination
- Most Massachusetts estates under federal threshold
- Focus MA planning on estates $2M-$13M
- Estates over federal exemption require coordinated federal/state planning

---

## 4. Conservative Strategies

### Credit Shelter Trust (Bypass Trust)
**How it works**: On first spouse's death, assets up to exemption amount pass to trust rather than outright to surviving spouse. Surviving spouse can receive income and limited principal.

**Benefits**:
- Preserves first spouse's MA exemption (no portability in MA)
- Assets not included in surviving spouse's estate
- Provides asset protection for surviving spouse

**Dollar Impact Formula**:
```
If Estate A = $3M, Estate B = $1M
Without CST: Combined estate at second death = $4M, taxed entirely
With CST: $2M in CST (not taxed) + $2M (at threshold) = significant savings
```

**Flag if**: Married couple with combined estate over $2M and no credit shelter provisions

### Portability Election (Federal Only)
**How it works**: Surviving spouse can use deceased spouse's unused federal exemption by filing estate tax return (even if no tax due).

**Benefits**:
- Doubles federal exemption for surviving spouse
- Simple to implement
- No trust required

**Limitations**:
- Does NOT apply to Massachusetts
- Must file Form 706 within 9 months (+ extensions)
- Lost if surviving spouse remarries and new spouse dies

**Flag if**: Estate near or exceeds federal exemption and no portability planning discussed

### Annual Gift Exclusion
**How it works**: Give up to annual exclusion amount ($18,000 in 2024, verify current) per recipient per year without gift tax consequences.

**Benefits**:
- Removes assets and future appreciation from estate
- No gift tax return required
- Unlimited number of recipients

**Dollar Impact Formula**:
```
Married couple, 3 children, 6 grandchildren = 9 recipients
Annual gifts: $18,000 × 2 × 9 = $324,000/year removed from estate
Over 5 years: $1.62M removed (plus appreciation)
```

**Flag if**: Taxable estate and no gifting program in place

---

## 5. Moderate Strategies

### Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)
**How it works**: Trust owns life insurance policy. Proceeds paid to trust, not estate.

**Benefits**:
- Life insurance proceeds excluded from taxable estate
- Provides liquidity for estate taxes without increasing estate
- Asset protection for beneficiaries

**Requirements**:
- Trust must be irrevocable
- Trustee (not insured) must own and pay premiums
- 3-year lookback for transferred policies
- Crummey notices required for premium gifts

**Dollar Impact Formula**:
```
$2M life insurance policy owned by decedent = $2M added to estate
Same policy in ILIT = $0 added to estate
At 16% MA rate = up to $320,000 tax savings
```

**Flag if**: Significant life insurance owned individually and taxable estate

### Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT)
**How it works**: Transfer home to irrevocable trust, retain right to live there for term of years. After term, home passes to beneficiaries at reduced gift tax value.

**Benefits**:
- Removes home from estate at discounted value
- Can continue living in home during trust term
- Freezes value for gift tax purposes

**Risks**:
- Must survive trust term or home returns to estate
- Lose step-up in basis
- Must pay rent after term ends if remaining in home

**Dollar Impact Formula**:
```
Home value: $1,500,000
QPRT term: 15 years, age 60
Gift tax value: ~$500,000 (varies by interest rates)
If survive term: $1.5M removed from estate, only $500K gift used
```

**Flag if**: High-value home, taxable estate, good health/life expectancy

### Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT)
**How it works**: Transfer assets to trust, receive income for life or term, remainder to charity.

**Benefits**:
- Immediate income tax deduction
- Removes assets from estate
- Income stream for donor
- Avoids capital gains on appreciated assets

**Types**:
- CRAT: Fixed annuity amount
- CRUT: Percentage of trust value (revalued annually)

**Flag if**: Charitable intent, appreciated assets, need for income

---

## 6. Advanced Strategies

### Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)
**How it works**: Transfer assets to trust, receive fixed annuity payments for term. Any appreciation above IRS rate passes to beneficiaries gift-tax-free.

**Benefits**:
- Can "zero-out" gift tax with proper structuring
- Transfers appreciation tax-free
- Useful for assets expected to appreciate

**Risks**:
- Must survive term
- No benefit if assets don't outperform IRS rate
- Complex administration

**Dollar Impact Example**:
```
$5M to GRAT, 2-year term, IRS rate 5%
Annuity payments return ~$5M to grantor
If assets appreciate 15%/year:
$5M × 1.15² = $6.6M
$6.6M - $5M = $1.6M to beneficiaries, gift-tax-free
```

**Flag if**: Very high net worth, assets likely to appreciate, willing to accept complexity

### Dynasty Trust
**How it works**: Long-term (perpetual in some states) trust that skips estate tax for multiple generations.

**Benefits**:
- Assets can grow for generations without estate tax
- Asset protection for beneficiaries
- Creditor protection

**Considerations**:
- Massachusetts Rule Against Perpetuities limits duration
- Consider establishing in state without RAP (Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota)
- Generation-skipping transfer tax implications

**Flag if**: Multigenerational wealth transfer goals, high net worth

### Family Limited Partnership (FLP)
**How it works**: Family creates partnership to hold assets. Parents gift limited partnership interests at discounted values.

**Benefits**:
- Valuation discounts (lack of control, lack of marketability)
- Centralized asset management
- Asset protection

**Risks**:
- IRS scrutiny
- Must maintain business purpose and formalities
- Complex setup and administration

**Discount Range**: Typically 20-35% combined discounts

**Flag if**: Family business, investment assets, willing to maintain formalities

### Charitable Lead Trust (CLT)
**How it works**: Opposite of CRT—charity receives income for term, remainder to beneficiaries.

**Benefits**:
- Can zero-out gift/estate tax on remainder
- Supports charity during term
- Passes appreciation to family

**Types**:
- Grantor CLT: Income tax deduction upfront
- Non-grantor CLT: Estate/gift tax reduction

**Flag if**: Charitable goals, want to pass wealth to family at reduced tax cost

---

## 7. Gift Tax Planning

### Lifetime Exemption
- Unified with estate tax exemption
- Gifts over annual exclusion count against lifetime exemption
- MA has no gift tax (federal only)

### Direct Payment Exclusions
- Tuition paid directly to institution: Unlimited, no gift tax
- Medical expenses paid directly to provider: Unlimited, no gift tax
- Does not count against annual exclusion

**Flag if**: Grandchildren in college, family medical expenses, no direct payment strategy

### 529 Plans
- 5-year gift averaging allows $90,000 lump sum ($18,000 × 5)
- Removes assets from estate
- Growth is tax-free for education

---

## 8. Income Tax Considerations

### Step-Up in Basis
- Inherited assets receive stepped-up basis to date-of-death value
- Eliminates capital gains on appreciation during decedent's life
- **Consideration**: Some strategies (like GRATs, gifts) lose step-up

### Inherited IRAs
- Required minimum distributions for beneficiaries
- 10-year rule for most non-spouse beneficiaries (SECURE Act)
- Trust as beneficiary may accelerate taxation

### Trust Income Taxation
- Trusts reach highest bracket quickly (~$14,000)
- Consider distributing income to beneficiaries in lower brackets
- Grantor trusts: Income taxed to grantor

## 9. Calculation Examples

### Example: MA Estate Tax Calculation
Estate: $4,000,000

**Current MA Tax Table (verify current rates)**:
| Taxable Amount | Rate |
|----------------|------|
| First $40,000 | 0.8% |
| $40K-$90K | 1.6% |
| $90K-$140K | 2.4% |
| ... | ... |
| Over $10.04M | 16% |

Approximate MA tax on $4M estate: ~$238,800

**With Credit Shelter Trust**:
- First spouse: $2M to CST (at threshold, minimal tax)
- Second spouse: $2M (at threshold, minimal tax)
- **Savings**: ~$238,800

### Example: ILIT Savings
Facts: $3M estate, $1M life insurance

**Without ILIT**:
- Taxable estate: $4M
- MA estate tax: ~$238,800

**With ILIT**:
- Taxable estate: $3M
- MA estate tax: ~$142,800
- **Savings**: ~$96,000
