This draft is not a substitute for professional legal advice.**\n\n\n## ARTICLE I: DECLARATION AND IDENTIFICATION\n\nI, **William Dinkleberry**, a resident of 742 Evergreen Bluff Drive, Cedar Ridge, Texas 77082, in [COUNTY] County, Texas, being of sound mind and legal age, do hereby make, publish, and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby expressly revoking all prior wills and codicils heretofore made by me.\n\nI was born on December 31, 1958, and am currently married.\n\n\n## ARTICLE II: FAMILY STATUS\n\nI am married to **Margaret Dinkleberry** (\"my Spouse\").\n\nI have one child: **Ben Dingleberry** (\"my Child\").\n\nAny reference in this Will to \"my Children\" shall include the above-named child and any children hereafter born to or legally adopted by me.\n\n\n## ARTICLE III: SPECIFIC BEQUESTS\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath the following specific bequests to the named beneficiaries, provided that each beneficiary survives me by at least forty-five (45) days:\n\nA.

If my Spouse, **Margaret Dinkleberry**, survives me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Spouse outright and free of trust.\n\nB. If my Spouse does not survive me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Child, **Ben Dingleberry**, or if my Child does not survive me, then to my Child's descendants, per stirpes.\n\nC.

Compensation**\n\nMy Executor shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for services rendered, as determined under Texas law.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VII: GUARDIAN NOMINATION\n\nThis provision is included for completeness, though my Child is believed to be an adult. If at the time of my death any of my Children are minors, I nominate and appoint **[GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as guardian of the person and estate of my minor Children. If **[GUARDIAN NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate guardian.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any guardian nominated herein.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VIII: NO-CONTEST CLAUSE\n\nIf any beneficiary under this Will contests or attacks this Will or any of its provisions, or aids or participates in any proceeding to contest or attack this Will or any of its provisions, any share or interest given to that contesting beneficiary under this Will is revoked and shall be disposed of as if that contesting beneficiary had predeceased me without descendants.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IX: TAX PROVISIONS\n\nAll estate, inheritance, succession, and other death taxes (including interest and penalties thereon) payable by reason of my death, whether attributable to property passing under this Will or otherwise, shall be paid out of my residuary estate without apportionment and without right of reimbursement from any person.\n\n\n## ARTICLE X: ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n**A. Definitions**\n\nAny reference to a statute or law shall include any amendments or successor provisions. When the context requires, words in the singular shall include the plural, and words in the plural shall include the singular.\n\n**B. Survivorship**\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Will, if any beneficiary and I die under circumstances where it is difficult or impossible to determine who died first, or if any beneficiary dies within forty-five (45) days after my death, that beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased me.\n\n**C. Governing Law**\n\nThis Will shall be construed and administered under the laws of the State of Texas.\n\n\n## ARTICLE XI: ORGAN DONATION\n\nI do **not** wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n## SIGNATURE AND ATTESTATION\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have subscribed my name to this Last Will and Testament this _____ day of ______________, 20___, declaring and publishing this instrument as my Last Will and Testament, in the presence of the undersigned witnesses, who witnessed and subscribed this Last Will and Testament at my request, and in my presence.\n\n\nSignature: ________________________________________\n\nPrint Name: William Dinkleberry\n\nDate: ________________________________________\n\n\n## ATTESTATION OF WITNESSES\n\nWe, the undersigned witnesses, each do hereby declare and attest that:\n\n1.

However, the estate plan has significant gaps that create substantial legal and financial risks. Most critically, there is NO incapacity planning whatsoever - no powers of attorney, healthcare directives, or HIPAA authorizations. This means if client becomes incapacitated, spouse and family would have no legal authority to manage finances or make healthcare decisions without expensive court proceedings. Additionally, beneficiary designations have never been reviewed, creating high risk that retirement accounts and life insurance will not coordinate with will provisions. The $3.5M estate size suggests a revocable living trust would be highly beneficial for probate avoidance, privacy, and efficiency, but none exists. Several coordination issues need immediate attention: unknown state law compliance, ambiguous charitable beneficiary, vehicle titling conflicts with specific bequests, and insufficient detail on personal property distribution. While the will provides a foundation, the estate plan is incomplete and leaves the client and family exposed to significant risks during incapacity and unnecessary costs/delays at death.\",\"immediateActionItems\":[\"Determine current state of residence and verify will complies with state law\",\"Execute durable financial power of attorney naming spouse as agent\",\"Execute healthcare power of attorney and living will documenting life support preferences\",\"Execute HIPAA authorization for spouse and family\",\"Conduct comprehensive beneficiary designation review and update all accounts\",\"Clarify legal entity for 'Kai Cenat stream' charitable bequest\",\"Verify title status of vehicles (Ford F-150, Dodge Hellcat) and align with bequest intentions\",\"Clarify 'my 5' reference in top priorities and ensure addressed in plan\",\"Create detailed personal property memorandum for valuable items\",\"Consult estate planning attorney about revocable living trust for $3.5M estate\"]}}","estatePlanId":"jh749kanapj006q5zabgfqk7mn7z610y","inconsistencies":"[]","medicaidPlanning":"{}","missingDocuments":"[]","multiPhaseRunId":"kx70bx6bpeb676gbeqbestjg657zkv6z","outdatedDocuments":"[]","priorityMatrix":"[]","rawAnalysis":"{\"score\":0,\"overallScore\":{\"score\":0,\"grade\":\"F\",\"summary\":\"Analysis incomplete\"},\"executiveSummary\":{\"oneLineInsight\":\"Analysis failed\",\"criticalIssues\":[],\"immediateActions\":[],\"opportunities\":[]},\"missingDocuments\":[],\"outdatedDocuments\":[],\"inconsistencies\":[],\"financialExposure\":{\"probate\":0,\"estateTax\":0,\"total\":0},\"taxStrategies\":[],\"stateSpecificNotes\":[],\"recommendations\":[],\"scenarioAnalysis\":[],\"priorityMatrix\":[],\"uncertaintyLog\":{\"assumptions\":[],\"limitations\":[\"Analysis incomplete\"],\"needsVerification\":[]},\"targetStateSummary\":{\"currentState\":\"Unknown\",\"targetState\":\"Unknown\",\"gapCount\":0,\"estimatedCostToClose\":{\"low\":0,\"high\":0},\"estimatedTimeline\":\"Unknown\"}}","recommendations":"[]","scenarioAnalysis":"[]","score":0,"stateResearch":"{\"type\":\"result\",\"subtype\":\"success\",\"is_error\":false,\"duration_ms\":5823,\"duration_api_ms\":5539,\"num_turns\":1,\"result\":\"I notice you've asked for information about \\\"Unknown\\\" estate planning requirements.

However, the estate plan has significant gaps that create substantial legal and financial risks. Most critically, there is NO incapacity planning whatsoever - no powers of attorney, healthcare directives, or HIPAA authorizations. This means if client becomes incapacitated, spouse and family would have no legal authority to manage finances or make healthcare decisions without expensive court proceedings. Additionally, beneficiary designations have never been reviewed, creating high risk that retirement accounts and life insurance will not coordinate with will provisions. The $3.5M estate size suggests a revocable living trust would be highly beneficial for probate avoidance, privacy, and efficiency, but none exists. Several coordination issues need immediate attention: unknown state law compliance, ambiguous charitable beneficiary, vehicle titling conflicts with specific bequests, and insufficient detail on personal property distribution. While the will provides a foundation, the estate plan is incomplete and leaves the client and family exposed to significant risks during incapacity and unnecessary costs/delays at death.\",\"immediateActionItems\":[\"Determine current state of residence and verify will complies with state law\",\"Execute durable financial power of attorney naming spouse as agent\",\"Execute healthcare power of attorney and living will documenting life support preferences\",\"Execute HIPAA authorization for spouse and family\",\"Conduct comprehensive beneficiary designation review and update all accounts\",\"Clarify legal entity for 'Kai Cenat stream' charitable bequest\",\"Verify title status of vehicles (Ford F-150, Dodge Hellcat) and align with bequest intentions\",\"Clarify 'my 5' reference in top priorities and ensure addressed in plan\",\"Create detailed personal property memorandum for valuable items\",\"Consult estate planning attorney about revocable living trust for $3.5M estate\"]}}","estatePlanId":"jh749kanapj006q5zabgfqk7mn7z610y","inconsistencies":"[]","medicaidPlanning":"{}","missingDocuments":"[]","multiPhaseRunId":"kx70bx6bpeb676gbeqbestjg657zkv6z","outdatedDocuments":"[]","priorityMatrix":"[]","rawAnalysis":"{\"score\":0,\"overallScore\":{\"score\":0,\"grade\":\"F\",\"summary\":\"Analysis incomplete\"},\"executiveSummary\":{\"oneLineInsight\":\"Analysis failed\",\"criticalIssues\":[],\"immediateActions\":[],\"opportunities\":[]},\"missingDocuments\":[],\"outdatedDocuments\":[],\"inconsistencies\":[],\"financialExposure\":{\"probate\":0,\"estateTax\":0,\"total\":0},\"taxStrategies\":[],\"stateSpecificNotes\":[],\"recommendations\":[],\"scenarioAnalysis\":[],\"priorityMatrix\":[],\"uncertaintyLog\":{\"assumptions\":[],\"limitations\":[\"Analysis incomplete\"],\"needsVerification\":[]},\"targetStateSummary\":{\"currentState\":\"Unknown\",\"targetState\":\"Unknown\",\"gapCount\":0,\"estimatedCostToClose\":{\"low\":0,\"high\":0},\"estimatedTimeline\":\"Unknown\"}}","recommendations":"[]","scenarioAnalysis":"[]","score":0,"stateResearch":"{\"type\":\"result\",\"subtype\":\"success\",\"is_error\":false,\"duration_ms\":5823,\"duration_api_ms\":5539,\"num_turns\":1,\"result\":\"I notice you've asked for information about \\\"Unknown\\\" estate planning requirements.

This draft is not a substitute for professional legal advice.**\n\n\n## ARTICLE I: DECLARATION AND IDENTIFICATION\n\nI, **William Dinkleberry**, a resident of 742 Evergreen Bluff Drive, Cedar Ridge, Texas 77082, in [COUNTY] County, Texas, being of sound mind and legal age, do hereby make, publish, and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby expressly revoking all prior wills and codicils heretofore made by me.\n\nI was born on December 31, 1958, and am currently married.\n\n\n## ARTICLE II: FAMILY STATUS\n\nI am married to **Margaret Dinkleberry** (\"my Spouse\").\n\nI have one child: **Ben Dingleberry** (\"my Child\").\n\nAny reference in this Will to \"my Children\" shall include the above-named child and any children hereafter born to or legally adopted by me.\n\n\n## ARTICLE III: SPECIFIC BEQUESTS\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath the following specific bequests to the named beneficiaries, provided that each beneficiary survives me by at least forty-five (45) days:\n\nA. I give my **2019 Ford F-150** to **Andrew** [LAST NAME AND RELATIONSHIP TO TESTATOR].\n\nB. I give my **vinyl records and audio equipment** to **Claire** [LAST NAME AND RELATIONSHIP TO TESTATOR].\n\nC. I give the sum of **Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00)** to **Hannah Whitaker**, provided she survives me by at least thirty (30) days.\n\nIf any beneficiary named in this Article does not survive me for the required survivorship period, then the bequest to that beneficiary shall lapse and become part of my residuary estate.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IV: CHARITABLE GIVING\n\nI direct my Executor to distribute such amounts from my estate to charitable organizations as my Executor, in consultation with my Spouse (if living), deems appropriate and consistent with my charitable intentions expressed during my lifetime.\n\n\n## ARTICLE V: RESIDUARY ESTATE\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, whether real, personal, or mixed, and wherever situated, including any lapsed bequests or devises (hereinafter referred to as my \"residuary estate\"), as follows:\n\nA. If my Spouse, **Margaret Dinkleberry**, survives me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Spouse outright and free of trust.\n\nB. If my Spouse does not survive me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Child, **Ben Dingleberry**, or if my Child does not survive me, then to my Child's descendants, per stirpes.\n\nC. For purposes of this Will, a person shall be deemed to have survived me only if such person is living on the forty-fifth (45th) day after my death.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VI: EXECUTOR APPOINTMENT AND POWERS\n\n**A. Appointment of Executor**\n\nI nominate and appoint **[PRIMARY EXECUTOR NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** to serve as Executor of this Will. If **[PRIMARY EXECUTOR NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve or continue to serve as Executor, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE EXECUTOR NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate Executor.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any Executor appointed under this Will.\n\n**B. Powers of Executor**\n\nIn addition to all powers granted by law, I grant my Executor full power and authority to administer my estate, including but not limited to the following powers, to be exercised in my Executor's sole discretion and without court approval:\n\n1. To retain, sell, exchange, lease, or otherwise dispose of any property belonging to my estate, on such terms as my Executor deems advisable;\n\n2. To invest and reinvest estate assets in any type of property or investment, without regard to any law restricting investments by fiduciaries;\n\n3. To borrow money on behalf of my estate and to mortgage or pledge estate assets as security;\n\n4. To make distributions in cash or in kind, or partly in each, and to allocate or distribute undivided interests or different assets to different beneficiaries;\n\n5. To employ attorneys, accountants, investment advisors, and other professionals, and to pay their reasonable compensation from estate assets;\n\n6. To settle, compromise, or contest claims in favor of or against my estate;\n\n7. To make tax elections and allocations that my Executor deems advisable to minimize overall tax burden on my estate and beneficiaries;\n\n8. To operate, maintain, or discontinue any business interest owned by me at the time of my death;\n\n9. To execute and deliver any instruments necessary or desirable to carry out these powers;\n\n10. To perform all other acts that my Executor deems necessary or advisable for the proper administration of my estate.\n\n**C. Compensation**\n\nMy Executor shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for services rendered, as determined under Texas law.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VII: GUARDIAN NOMINATION\n\nThis provision is included for completeness, though my Child is believed to be an adult.

This draft is not a substitute for professional legal advice.**\n\n\n## ARTICLE I: DECLARATION AND IDENTIFICATION\n\nI, **William Dinkleberry**, a resident of 742 Evergreen Bluff Drive, Cedar Ridge, Texas 77082, in [COUNTY] County, Texas, being of sound mind and legal age, do hereby make, publish, and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby expressly revoking all prior wills and codicils heretofore made by me.\n\nI was born on December 31, 1958, and am currently married.\n\n\n## ARTICLE II: FAMILY STATUS\n\nI am married to **Margaret Dinkleberry** (\"my Spouse\").\n\nI have one child: **Ben Dingleberry** (\"my Child\").\n\nAny reference in this Will to \"my Children\" shall include the above-named child and any children hereafter born to or legally adopted by me.\n\n\n## ARTICLE III: SPECIFIC BEQUESTS\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath the following specific bequests to the named beneficiaries, provided that each beneficiary survives me by at least forty-five (45) days:\n\nA. I give my **2019 Ford F-150** to **Andrew** [LAST NAME AND RELATIONSHIP TO TESTATOR].\n\nB. I give my **vinyl records and audio equipment** to **Claire** [LAST NAME AND RELATIONSHIP TO TESTATOR].\n\nC. I give the sum of **Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00)** to **Hannah Whitaker**, provided she survives me by at least thirty (30) days.\n\nIf any beneficiary named in this Article does not survive me for the required survivorship period, then the bequest to that beneficiary shall lapse and become part of my residuary estate.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IV: CHARITABLE GIVING\n\nI direct my Executor to distribute such amounts from my estate to charitable organizations as my Executor, in consultation with my Spouse (if living), deems appropriate and consistent with my charitable intentions expressed during my lifetime.\n\n\n## ARTICLE V: RESIDUARY ESTATE\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, whether real, personal, or mixed, and wherever situated, including any lapsed bequests or devises (hereinafter referred to as my \"residuary estate\"), as follows:\n\nA. If my Spouse, **Margaret Dinkleberry**, survives me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Spouse outright and free of trust.\n\nB. If my Spouse does not survive me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Child, **Ben Dingleberry**, or if my Child does not survive me, then to my Child's descendants, per stirpes.\n\nC. For purposes of this Will, a person shall be deemed to have survived me only if such person is living on the forty-fifth (45th) day after my death.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VI: EXECUTOR APPOINTMENT AND POWERS\n\n**A. Appointment of Executor**\n\nI nominate and appoint **[PRIMARY EXECUTOR NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** to serve as Executor of this Will. If **[PRIMARY EXECUTOR NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve or continue to serve as Executor, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE EXECUTOR NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate Executor.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any Executor appointed under this Will.\n\n**B. Powers of Executor**\n\nIn addition to all powers granted by law, I grant my Executor full power and authority to administer my estate, including but not limited to the following powers, to be exercised in my Executor's sole discretion and without court approval:\n\n1. To retain, sell, exchange, lease, or otherwise dispose of any property belonging to my estate, on such terms as my Executor deems advisable;\n\n2. To invest and reinvest estate assets in any type of property or investment, without regard to any law restricting investments by fiduciaries;\n\n3. To borrow money on behalf of my estate and to mortgage or pledge estate assets as security;\n\n4. To make distributions in cash or in kind, or partly in each, and to allocate or distribute undivided interests or different assets to different beneficiaries;\n\n5. To employ attorneys, accountants, investment advisors, and other professionals, and to pay their reasonable compensation from estate assets;\n\n6. To settle, compromise, or contest claims in favor of or against my estate;\n\n7. To make tax elections and allocations that my Executor deems advisable to minimize overall tax burden on my estate and beneficiaries;\n\n8. To operate, maintain, or discontinue any business interest owned by me at the time of my death;\n\n9. To execute and deliver any instruments necessary or desirable to carry out these powers;\n\n10. To perform all other acts that my Executor deems necessary or advisable for the proper administration of my estate.\n\n**C. Compensation**\n\nMy Executor shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for services rendered, as determined under Texas law.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VII: GUARDIAN NOMINATION\n\nThis provision is included for completeness, though my Child is believed to be an adult. If at the time of my death any of my Children are minors, I nominate and appoint **[GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as guardian of the person and estate of my minor Children. If **[GUARDIAN NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate guardian.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any guardian nominated herein.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VIII: NO-CONTEST CLAUSE\n\nIf any beneficiary under this Will contests or attacks this Will or any of its provisions, or aids or participates in any proceeding to contest or attack this Will or any of its provisions, any share or interest given to that contesting beneficiary under this Will is revoked and shall be disposed of as if that contesting beneficiary had predeceased me without descendants.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IX: TAX PROVISIONS\n\nAll estate, inheritance, succession, and other death taxes (including interest and penalties thereon) payable by reason of my death, whether attributable to property passing under this Will or otherwise, shall be paid out of my residuary estate without apportionment and without right of reimbursement from any person.\n\n\n## ARTICLE X: ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n**A. Definitions**\n\nAny reference to a statute or law shall include any amendments or successor provisions. When the context requires, words in the singular shall include the plural, and words in the plural shall include the singular.\n\n**B. Survivorship**\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Will, if any beneficiary and I die under circumstances where it is difficult or impossible to determine who died first, or if any beneficiary dies within forty-five (45) days after my death, that beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased me.\n\n**C. Governing Law**\n\nThis Will shall be construed and administered under the laws of the State of Texas.\n\n\n## ARTICLE XI: ORGAN DONATION\n\nI do **not** wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n## SIGNATURE AND ATTESTATION\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have subscribed my name to this Last Will and Testament this _____ day of ______________, 20___, declaring and publishing this instrument as my Last Will and Testament, in the presence of the undersigned witnesses, who witnessed and subscribed this Last Will and Testament at my request, and in my presence.\n\n\nSignature: ________________________________________\n\nPrint Name: William Dinkleberry\n\nDate: ________________________________________\n\n\n## ATTESTATION OF WITNESSES\n\nWe, the undersigned witnesses, each do hereby declare and attest that:\n\n1.

This draft is not a substitute for professional legal advice.**\n\n\n## ARTICLE I: DECLARATION AND IDENTIFICATION\n\nI, **William Dinkleberry**, a resident of 742 Evergreen Bluff Drive, Cedar Ridge, Texas 77082, in [COUNTY] County, Texas, being of sound mind and legal age, do hereby make, publish, and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby expressly revoking all prior wills and codicils heretofore made by me.\n\nI was born on December 31, 1958, and am currently married.\n\n\n## ARTICLE II: FAMILY STATUS\n\nI am married to **Margaret Dinkleberry** (\"my Spouse\").\n\nI have one child: **Ben Dingleberry** (\"my Child\").\n\nAny reference in this Will to \"my Children\" shall include the above-named child and any children hereafter born to or legally adopted by me.\n\n\n## ARTICLE III: SPECIFIC BEQUESTS\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath the following specific bequests to the named beneficiaries, provided that each beneficiary survives me by at least forty-five (45) days:\n\nA. I give my **2019 Ford F-150** to **Andrew** [LAST NAME AND RELATIONSHIP TO TESTATOR].\n\nB.

I give the sum of **Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00)** to **Hannah Whitaker**, provided she survives me by at least thirty (30) days.\n\nIf any beneficiary named in this Article does not survive me for the required survivorship period, then the bequest to that beneficiary shall lapse and become part of my residuary estate.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IV: CHARITABLE GIVING\n\nI direct my Executor to distribute such amounts from my estate to charitable organizations as my Executor, in consultation with my Spouse (if living), deems appropriate and consistent with my charitable intentions expressed during my lifetime.\n\n\n## ARTICLE V: RESIDUARY ESTATE\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, whether real, personal, or mixed, and wherever situated, including any lapsed bequests or devises (hereinafter referred to as my \"residuary estate\"), as follows:\n\nA. If my Spouse, **Margaret Dinkleberry**, survives me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Spouse outright and free of trust.\n\nB. If my Spouse does not survive me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Child, **Ben Dingleberry**, or if my Child does not survive me, then to my Child's descendants, per stirpes.\n\nC. For purposes of this Will, a person shall be deemed to have survived me only if such person is living on the forty-fifth (45th) day after my death.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VI: EXECUTOR APPOINTMENT AND POWERS\n\n**A. Appointment of Executor**\n\nI nominate and appoint **[PRIMARY EXECUTOR NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** to serve as Executor of this Will. If **[PRIMARY EXECUTOR NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve or continue to serve as Executor, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE EXECUTOR NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate Executor.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any Executor appointed under this Will.\n\n**B. Powers of Executor**\n\nIn addition to all powers granted by law, I grant my Executor full power and authority to administer my estate, including but not limited to the following powers, to be exercised in my Executor's sole discretion and without court approval:\n\n1. To retain, sell, exchange, lease, or otherwise dispose of any property belonging to my estate, on such terms as my Executor deems advisable;\n\n2. To invest and reinvest estate assets in any type of property or investment, without regard to any law restricting investments by fiduciaries;\n\n3. To borrow money on behalf of my estate and to mortgage or pledge estate assets as security;\n\n4. To make distributions in cash or in kind, or partly in each, and to allocate or distribute undivided interests or different assets to different beneficiaries;\n\n5. To employ attorneys, accountants, investment advisors, and other professionals, and to pay their reasonable compensation from estate assets;\n\n6. To settle, compromise, or contest claims in favor of or against my estate;\n\n7. To make tax elections and allocations that my Executor deems advisable to minimize overall tax burden on my estate and beneficiaries;\n\n8. To operate, maintain, or discontinue any business interest owned by me at the time of my death;\n\n9. To execute and deliver any instruments necessary or desirable to carry out these powers;\n\n10. To perform all other acts that my Executor deems necessary or advisable for the proper administration of my estate.\n\n**C. Compensation**\n\nMy Executor shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for services rendered, as determined under Texas law.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VII: GUARDIAN NOMINATION\n\nThis provision is included for completeness, though my Child is believed to be an adult. If at the time of my death any of my Children are minors, I nominate and appoint **[GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as guardian of the person and estate of my minor Children. If **[GUARDIAN NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate guardian.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any guardian nominated herein.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VIII: NO-CONTEST CLAUSE\n\nIf any beneficiary under this Will contests or attacks this Will or any of its provisions, or aids or participates in any proceeding to contest or attack this Will or any of its provisions, any share or interest given to that contesting beneficiary under this Will is revoked and shall be disposed of as if that contesting beneficiary had predeceased me without descendants.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IX: TAX PROVISIONS\n\nAll estate, inheritance, succession, and other death taxes (including interest and penalties thereon) payable by reason of my death, whether attributable to property passing under this Will or otherwise, shall be paid out of my residuary estate without apportionment and without right of reimbursement from any person.\n\n\n## ARTICLE X: ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n**A. Definitions**\n\nAny reference to a statute or law shall include any amendments or successor provisions. When the context requires, words in the singular shall include the plural, and words in the plural shall include the singular.\n\n**B. Survivorship**\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Will, if any beneficiary and I die under circumstances where it is difficult or impossible to determine who died first, or if any beneficiary dies within forty-five (45) days after my death, that beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased me.\n\n**C. Governing Law**\n\nThis Will shall be construed and administered under the laws of the State of Texas.\n\n\n## ARTICLE XI: ORGAN DONATION\n\nI do **not** wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n## SIGNATURE AND ATTESTATION\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have subscribed my name to this Last Will and Testament this _____ day of ______________, 20___, declaring and publishing this instrument as my Last Will and Testament, in the presence of the undersigned witnesses, who witnessed and subscribed this Last Will and Testament at my request, and in my presence.\n\n\nSignature: ________________________________________\n\nPrint Name: William Dinkleberry\n\nDate: ________________________________________\n\n\n## ATTESTATION OF WITNESSES\n\nWe, the undersigned witnesses, each do hereby declare and attest that:\n\n1.

This draft is not a substitute for professional legal advice.**\n\n\n## ARTICLE I: DECLARATION AND IDENTIFICATION\n\nI, **William Dinkleberry**, a resident of 742 Evergreen Bluff Drive, Cedar Ridge, Texas 77082, in [COUNTY] County, Texas, being of sound mind and legal age, do hereby make, publish, and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby expressly revoking all prior wills and codicils heretofore made by me.\n\nI was born on December 31, 1958, and am currently married.\n\n\n## ARTICLE II: FAMILY STATUS\n\nI am married to **Margaret Dinkleberry** (\"my Spouse\").\n\nI have one child: **Ben Dingleberry** (\"my Child\").\n\nAny reference in this Will to \"my Children\" shall include the above-named child and any children hereafter born to or legally adopted by me.\n\n\n## ARTICLE III: SPECIFIC BEQUESTS\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath the following specific bequests to the named beneficiaries, provided that each beneficiary survives me by at least forty-five (45) days:\n\nA. I give my **2019 Ford F-150** to **Andrew** [LAST NAME AND RELATIONSHIP TO TESTATOR].\n\nB.

I give the sum of **Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00)** to **Hannah Whitaker**, provided she survives me by at least thirty (30) days.\n\nIf any beneficiary named in this Article does not survive me for the required survivorship period, then the bequest to that beneficiary shall lapse and become part of my residuary estate.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IV: CHARITABLE GIVING\n\nI direct my Executor to distribute such amounts from my estate to charitable organizations as my Executor, in consultation with my Spouse (if living), deems appropriate and consistent with my charitable intentions expressed during my lifetime.\n\n\n## ARTICLE V: RESIDUARY ESTATE\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, whether real, personal, or mixed, and wherever situated, including any lapsed bequests or devises (hereinafter referred to as my \"residuary estate\"), as follows:\n\nA. If my Spouse, **Margaret Dinkleberry**, survives me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Spouse outright and free of trust.\n\nB. If my Spouse does not survive me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Child, **Ben Dingleberry**, or if my Child does not survive me, then to my Child's descendants, per stirpes.\n\nC. For purposes of this Will, a person shall be deemed to have survived me only if such person is living on the forty-fifth (45th) day after my death.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VI: EXECUTOR APPOINTMENT AND POWERS\n\n**A. Appointment of Executor**\n\nI nominate and appoint **[PRIMARY EXECUTOR NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** to serve as Executor of this Will.

Powers of Executor**\n\nIn addition to all powers granted by law, I grant my Executor full power and authority to administer my estate, including but not limited to the following powers, to be exercised in my Executor's sole discretion and without court approval:\n\n1. To retain, sell, exchange, lease, or otherwise dispose of any property belonging to my estate, on such terms as my Executor deems advisable;\n\n2. To invest and reinvest estate assets in any type of property or investment, without regard to any law restricting investments by fiduciaries;\n\n3. To borrow money on behalf of my estate and to mortgage or pledge estate assets as security;\n\n4. To make distributions in cash or in kind, or partly in each, and to allocate or distribute undivided interests or different assets to different beneficiaries;\n\n5. To employ attorneys, accountants, investment advisors, and other professionals, and to pay their reasonable compensation from estate assets;\n\n6. To settle, compromise, or contest claims in favor of or against my estate;\n\n7. To make tax elections and allocations that my Executor deems advisable to minimize overall tax burden on my estate and beneficiaries;\n\n8. To operate, maintain, or discontinue any business interest owned by me at the time of my death;\n\n9. To execute and deliver any instruments necessary or desirable to carry out these powers;\n\n10. To perform all other acts that my Executor deems necessary or advisable for the proper administration of my estate.\n\n**C. Compensation**\n\nMy Executor shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for services rendered, as determined under Texas law.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VII: GUARDIAN NOMINATION\n\nThis provision is included for completeness, though my Child is believed to be an adult. If at the time of my death any of my Children are minors, I nominate and appoint **[GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as guardian of the person and estate of my minor Children. If **[GUARDIAN NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate guardian.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any guardian nominated herein.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VIII: NO-CONTEST CLAUSE\n\nIf any beneficiary under this Will contests or attacks this Will or any of its provisions, or aids or participates in any proceeding to contest or attack this Will or any of its provisions, any share or interest given to that contesting beneficiary under this Will is revoked and shall be disposed of as if that contesting beneficiary had predeceased me without descendants.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IX: TAX PROVISIONS\n\nAll estate, inheritance, succession, and other death taxes (including interest and penalties thereon) payable by reason of my death, whether attributable to property passing under this Will or otherwise, shall be paid out of my residuary estate without apportionment and without right of reimbursement from any person.\n\n\n## ARTICLE X: ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n**A. Definitions**\n\nAny reference to a statute or law shall include any amendments or successor provisions. When the context requires, words in the singular shall include the plural, and words in the plural shall include the singular.\n\n**B. Survivorship**\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Will, if any beneficiary and I die under circumstances where it is difficult or impossible to determine who died first, or if any beneficiary dies within forty-five (45) days after my death, that beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased me.\n\n**C. Governing Law**\n\nThis Will shall be construed and administered under the laws of the State of Texas.\n\n\n## ARTICLE XI: ORGAN DONATION\n\nI do **not** wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n## SIGNATURE AND ATTESTATION\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have subscribed my name to this Last Will and Testament this _____ day of ______________, 20___, declaring and publishing this instrument as my Last Will and Testament, in the presence of the undersigned witnesses, who witnessed and subscribed this Last Will and Testament at my request, and in my presence.\n\n\nSignature: ________________________________________\n\nPrint Name: William Dinkleberry\n\nDate: ________________________________________\n\n\n## ATTESTATION OF WITNESSES\n\nWe, the undersigned witnesses, each do hereby declare and attest that:\n\n1.

This draft is not a substitute for professional legal advice.**\n\n\n## ARTICLE I: DECLARATION AND IDENTIFICATION\n\nI, **William Dinkleberry**, a resident of 742 Evergreen Bluff Drive, Cedar Ridge, Texas 77082, in [COUNTY] County, Texas, being of sound mind and legal age, do hereby make, publish, and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby expressly revoking all prior wills and codicils heretofore made by me.\n\nI was born on December 31, 1958, and am currently married.\n\n\n## ARTICLE II: FAMILY STATUS\n\nI am married to **Margaret Dinkleberry** (\"my Spouse\").\n\nI have one child: **Ben Dingleberry** (\"my Child\").\n\nAny reference in this Will to \"my Children\" shall include the above-named child and any children hereafter born to or legally adopted by me.\n\n\n## ARTICLE III: SPECIFIC BEQUESTS\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath the following specific bequests to the named beneficiaries, provided that each beneficiary survives me by at least forty-five (45) days:\n\nA.

If my Spouse, **Margaret Dinkleberry**, survives me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Spouse outright and free of trust.\n\nB. If my Spouse does not survive me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Child, **Ben Dingleberry**, or if my Child does not survive me, then to my Child's descendants, per stirpes.\n\nC. For purposes of this Will, a person shall be deemed to have survived me only if such person is living on the forty-fifth (45th) day after my death.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VI: EXECUTOR APPOINTMENT AND POWERS\n\n**A. Appointment of Executor**\n\nI nominate and appoint **[PRIMARY EXECUTOR NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** to serve as Executor of this Will.

To make distributions in cash or in kind, or partly in each, and to allocate or distribute undivided interests or different assets to different beneficiaries;\n\n5. To employ attorneys, accountants, investment advisors, and other professionals, and to pay their reasonable compensation from estate assets;\n\n6. To settle, compromise, or contest claims in favor of or against my estate;\n\n7.

To operate, maintain, or discontinue any business interest owned by me at the time of my death;\n\n9. To execute and deliver any instruments necessary or desirable to carry out these powers;\n\n10. To perform all other acts that my Executor deems necessary or advisable for the proper administration of my estate.\n\n**C. Compensation**\n\nMy Executor shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for services rendered, as determined under Texas law.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VII: GUARDIAN NOMINATION\n\nThis provision is included for completeness, though my Child is believed to be an adult. If at the time of my death any of my Children are minors, I nominate and appoint **[GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as guardian of the person and estate of my minor Children. If **[GUARDIAN NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate guardian.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any guardian nominated herein.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VIII: NO-CONTEST CLAUSE\n\nIf any beneficiary under this Will contests or attacks this Will or any of its provisions, or aids or participates in any proceeding to contest or attack this Will or any of its provisions, any share or interest given to that contesting beneficiary under this Will is revoked and shall be disposed of as if that contesting beneficiary had predeceased me without descendants.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IX: TAX PROVISIONS\n\nAll estate, inheritance, succession, and other death taxes (including interest and penalties thereon) payable by reason of my death, whether attributable to property passing under this Will or otherwise, shall be paid out of my residuary estate without apportionment and without right of reimbursement from any person.\n\n\n## ARTICLE X: ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n**A. Definitions**\n\nAny reference to a statute or law shall include any amendments or successor provisions. When the context requires, words in the singular shall include the plural, and words in the plural shall include the singular.\n\n**B. Survivorship**\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Will, if any beneficiary and I die under circumstances where it is difficult or impossible to determine who died first, or if any beneficiary dies within forty-five (45) days after my death, that beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased me.\n\n**C. Governing Law**\n\nThis Will shall be construed and administered under the laws of the State of Texas.\n\n\n## ARTICLE XI: ORGAN DONATION\n\nI do **not** wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n## SIGNATURE AND ATTESTATION\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have subscribed my name to this Last Will and Testament this _____ day of ______________, 20___, declaring and publishing this instrument as my Last Will and Testament, in the presence of the undersigned witnesses, who witnessed and subscribed this Last Will and Testament at my request, and in my presence.\n\n\nSignature: ________________________________________\n\nPrint Name: William Dinkleberry\n\nDate: ________________________________________\n\n\n## ATTESTATION OF WITNESSES\n\nWe, the undersigned witnesses, each do hereby declare and attest that:\n\n1.

This draft is not a substitute for professional legal advice.**\n\n\n## ARTICLE I: DECLARATION AND IDENTIFICATION\n\nI, **William Dinkleberry**, a resident of 742 Evergreen Bluff Drive, Cedar Ridge, Texas 77082, in [COUNTY] County, Texas, being of sound mind and legal age, do hereby make, publish, and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby expressly revoking all prior wills and codicils heretofore made by me.\n\nI was born on December 31, 1958, and am currently married.\n\n\n## ARTICLE II: FAMILY STATUS\n\nI am married to **Margaret Dinkleberry** (\"my Spouse\").\n\nI have one child: **Ben Dingleberry** (\"my Child\").\n\nAny reference in this Will to \"my Children\" shall include the above-named child and any children hereafter born to or legally adopted by me.\n\n\n## ARTICLE III: SPECIFIC BEQUESTS\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath the following specific bequests to the named beneficiaries, provided that each beneficiary survives me by at least forty-five (45) days:\n\nA. I give my **2019 Ford F-150** to **Andrew** [LAST NAME AND RELATIONSHIP TO TESTATOR].\n\nB. I give my **vinyl records and audio equipment** to **Claire** [LAST NAME AND RELATIONSHIP TO TESTATOR].\n\nC. I give the sum of **Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00)** to **Hannah Whitaker**, provided she survives me by at least thirty (30) days.\n\nIf any beneficiary named in this Article does not survive me for the required survivorship period, then the bequest to that beneficiary shall lapse and become part of my residuary estate.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IV: CHARITABLE GIVING\n\nI direct my Executor to distribute such amounts from my estate to charitable organizations as my Executor, in consultation with my Spouse (if living), deems appropriate and consistent with my charitable intentions expressed during my lifetime.\n\n\n## ARTICLE V: RESIDUARY ESTATE\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, whether real, personal, or mixed, and wherever situated, including any lapsed bequests or devises (hereinafter referred to as my \"residuary estate\"), as follows:\n\nA. If my Spouse, **Margaret Dinkleberry**, survives me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Spouse outright and free of trust.\n\nB. If my Spouse does not survive me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Child, **Ben Dingleberry**, or if my Child does not survive me, then to my Child's descendants, per stirpes.\n\nC. For purposes of this Will, a person shall be deemed to have survived me only if such person is living on the forty-fifth (45th) day after my death.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VI: EXECUTOR APPOINTMENT AND POWERS\n\n**A. Appointment of Executor**\n\nI nominate and appoint **[PRIMARY EXECUTOR NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** to serve as Executor of this Will. If **[PRIMARY EXECUTOR NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve or continue to serve as Executor, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE EXECUTOR NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate Executor.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any Executor appointed under this Will.\n\n**B. Powers of Executor**\n\nIn addition to all powers granted by law, I grant my Executor full power and authority to administer my estate, including but not limited to the following powers, to be exercised in my Executor's sole discretion and without court approval:\n\n1. To retain, sell, exchange, lease, or otherwise dispose of any property belonging to my estate, on such terms as my Executor deems advisable;\n\n2. To invest and reinvest estate assets in any type of property or investment, without regard to any law restricting investments by fiduciaries;\n\n3. To borrow money on behalf of my estate and to mortgage or pledge estate assets as security;\n\n4. To make distributions in cash or in kind, or partly in each, and to allocate or distribute undivided interests or different assets to different beneficiaries;\n\n5. To employ attorneys, accountants, investment advisors, and other professionals, and to pay their reasonable compensation from estate assets;\n\n6. To settle, compromise, or contest claims in favor of or against my estate;\n\n7. To make tax elections and allocations that my Executor deems advisable to minimize overall tax burden on my estate and beneficiaries;\n\n8. To operate, maintain, or discontinue any business interest owned by me at the time of my death;\n\n9. To execute and deliver any instruments necessary or desirable to carry out these powers;\n\n10. To perform all other acts that my Executor deems necessary or advisable for the proper administration of my estate.\n\n**C. Compensation**\n\nMy Executor shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for services rendered, as determined under Texas law.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VII: GUARDIAN NOMINATION\n\nThis provision is included for completeness, though my Child is believed to be an adult. If at the time of my death any of my Children are minors, I nominate and appoint **[GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as guardian of the person and estate of my minor Children. If **[GUARDIAN NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate guardian.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any guardian nominated herein.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VIII: NO-CONTEST CLAUSE\n\nIf any beneficiary under this Will contests or attacks this Will or any of its provisions, or aids or participates in any proceeding to contest or attack this Will or any of its provisions, any share or interest given to that contesting beneficiary under this Will is revoked and shall be disposed of as if that contesting beneficiary had predeceased me without descendants.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IX: TAX PROVISIONS\n\nAll estate, inheritance, succession, and other death taxes (including interest and penalties thereon) payable by reason of my death, whether attributable to property passing under this Will or otherwise, shall be paid out of my residuary estate without apportionment and without right of reimbursement from any person.\n\n\n## ARTICLE X: ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n**A. Definitions**\n\nAny reference to a statute or law shall include any amendments or successor provisions. When the context requires, words in the singular shall include the plural, and words in the plural shall include the singular.\n\n**B. Survivorship**\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Will, if any beneficiary and I die under circumstances where it is difficult or impossible to determine who died first, or if any beneficiary dies within forty-five (45) days after my death, that beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased me.\n\n**C. Governing Law**\n\nThis Will shall be construed and administered under the laws of the State of Texas.\n\n\n## ARTICLE XI: ORGAN DONATION\n\nI do **not** wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n## SIGNATURE AND ATTESTATION\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have subscribed my name to this Last Will and Testament this _____ day of ______________, 20___, declaring and publishing this instrument as my Last Will and Testament, in the presence of the undersigned witnesses, who witnessed and subscribed this Last Will and Testament at my request, and in my presence.\n\n\nSignature: ________________________________________\n\nPrint Name: William Dinkleberry\n\nDate: ________________________________________\n\n\n## ATTESTATION OF WITNESSES\n\nWe, the undersigned witnesses, each do hereby declare and attest that:\n\n1.

If my Spouse, **Margaret Dinkleberry**, survives me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Spouse outright and free of trust.\n\nB. If my Spouse does not survive me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Child, **Ben Dingleberry**, or if my Child does not survive me, then to my Child's descendants, per stirpes.\n\nC. For purposes of this Will, a person shall be deemed to have survived me only if such person is living on the forty-fifth (45th) day after my death.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VI: EXECUTOR APPOINTMENT AND POWERS\n\n**A. Appointment of Executor**\n\nI nominate and appoint **[PRIMARY EXECUTOR NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** to serve as Executor of this Will.

To retain, sell, exchange, lease, or otherwise dispose of any property belonging to my estate, on such terms as my Executor deems advisable;\n\n2. To invest and reinvest estate assets in any type of property or investment, without regard to any law restricting investments by fiduciaries;\n\n3.

To employ attorneys, accountants, investment advisors, and other professionals, and to pay their reasonable compensation from estate assets;\n\n6. To settle, compromise, or contest claims in favor of or against my estate;\n\n7.

Compensation**\n\nMy Executor shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for services rendered, as determined under Texas law.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VII: GUARDIAN NOMINATION\n\nThis provision is included for completeness, though my Child is believed to be an adult. If at the time of my death any of my Children are minors, I nominate and appoint **[GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as guardian of the person and estate of my minor Children. If **[GUARDIAN NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate guardian.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any guardian nominated herein.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VIII: NO-CONTEST CLAUSE\n\nIf any beneficiary under this Will contests or attacks this Will or any of its provisions, or aids or participates in any proceeding to contest or attack this Will or any of its provisions, any share or interest given to that contesting beneficiary under this Will is revoked and shall be disposed of as if that contesting beneficiary had predeceased me without descendants.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IX: TAX PROVISIONS\n\nAll estate, inheritance, succession, and other death taxes (including interest and penalties thereon) payable by reason of my death, whether attributable to property passing under this Will or otherwise, shall be paid out of my residuary estate without apportionment and without right of reimbursement from any person.\n\n\n## ARTICLE X: ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n**A. Definitions**\n\nAny reference to a statute or law shall include any amendments or successor provisions. When the context requires, words in the singular shall include the plural, and words in the plural shall include the singular.\n\n**B. Survivorship**\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Will, if any beneficiary and I die under circumstances where it is difficult or impossible to determine who died first, or if any beneficiary dies within forty-five (45) days after my death, that beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased me.\n\n**C. Governing Law**\n\nThis Will shall be construed and administered under the laws of the State of Texas.\n\n\n## ARTICLE XI: ORGAN DONATION\n\nI do **not** wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n## SIGNATURE AND ATTESTATION\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have subscribed my name to this Last Will and Testament this _____ day of ______________, 20___, declaring and publishing this instrument as my Last Will and Testament, in the presence of the undersigned witnesses, who witnessed and subscribed this Last Will and Testament at my request, and in my presence.\n\n\nSignature: ________________________________________\n\nPrint Name: William Dinkleberry\n\nDate: ________________________________________\n\n\n## ATTESTATION OF WITNESSES\n\nWe, the undersigned witnesses, each do hereby declare and attest that:\n\n1.
