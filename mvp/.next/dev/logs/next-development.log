This draft is not a substitute for professional legal advice.**\n\n\n## ARTICLE I: DECLARATION AND IDENTIFICATION\n\nI, **William Dinkleberry**, a resident of 742 Evergreen Bluff Drive, Cedar Ridge, Texas 77082, in [COUNTY] County, Texas, being of sound mind and legal age, do hereby make, publish, and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby expressly revoking all prior wills and codicils heretofore made by me.\n\nI was born on December 31, 1958, and am currently married.\n\n\n## ARTICLE II: FAMILY STATUS\n\nI am married to **Margaret Dinkleberry** (\"my Spouse\").\n\nI have one child: **Ben Dingleberry** (\"my Child\").\n\nAny reference in this Will to \"my Children\" shall include the above-named child and any children hereafter born to or legally adopted by me.\n\n\n## ARTICLE III: SPECIFIC BEQUESTS\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath the following specific bequests to the named beneficiaries, provided that each beneficiary survives me by at least forty-five (45) days:\n\nA. I give my **2019 Ford F-150** to **Andrew** [LAST NAME AND RELATIONSHIP TO TESTATOR].\n\nB. I give my **vinyl records and audio equipment** to **Claire** [LAST NAME AND RELATIONSHIP TO TESTATOR].\n\nC. I give the sum of **Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00)** to **Hannah Whitaker**, provided she survives me by at least thirty (30) days.\n\nIf any beneficiary named in this Article does not survive me for the required survivorship period, then the bequest to that beneficiary shall lapse and become part of my residuary estate.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IV: CHARITABLE GIVING\n\nI direct my Executor to distribute such amounts from my estate to charitable organizations as my Executor, in consultation with my Spouse (if living), deems appropriate and consistent with my charitable intentions expressed during my lifetime.\n\n\n## ARTICLE V: RESIDUARY ESTATE\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, whether real, personal, or mixed, and wherever situated, including any lapsed bequests or devises (hereinafter referred to as my \"residuary estate\"), as follows:\n\nA. If my Spouse, **Margaret Dinkleberry**, survives me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Spouse outright and free of trust.\n\nB. If my Spouse does not survive me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Child, **Ben Dingleberry**, or if my Child does not survive me, then to my Child's descendants, per stirpes.\n\nC. For purposes of this Will, a person shall be deemed to have survived me only if such person is living on the forty-fifth (45th) day after my death.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VI: EXECUTOR APPOINTMENT AND POWERS\n\n**A. Appointment of Executor**\n\nI nominate and appoint **[PRIMARY EXECUTOR NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** to serve as Executor of this Will. If **[PRIMARY EXECUTOR NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve or continue to serve as Executor, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE EXECUTOR NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate Executor.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any Executor appointed under this Will.\n\n**B. Powers of Executor**\n\nIn addition to all powers granted by law, I grant my Executor full power and authority to administer my estate, including but not limited to the following powers, to be exercised in my Executor's sole discretion and without court approval:\n\n1. To retain, sell, exchange, lease, or otherwise dispose of any property belonging to my estate, on such terms as my Executor deems advisable;\n\n2. To invest and reinvest estate assets in any type of property or investment, without regard to any law restricting investments by fiduciaries;\n\n3. To borrow money on behalf of my estate and to mortgage or pledge estate assets as security;\n\n4. To make distributions in cash or in kind, or partly in each, and to allocate or distribute undivided interests or different assets to different beneficiaries;\n\n5. To employ attorneys, accountants, investment advisors, and other professionals, and to pay their reasonable compensation from estate assets;\n\n6. To settle, compromise, or contest claims in favor of or against my estate;\n\n7. To make tax elections and allocations that my Executor deems advisable to minimize overall tax burden on my estate and beneficiaries;\n\n8. To operate, maintain, or discontinue any business interest owned by me at the time of my death;\n\n9. To execute and deliver any instruments necessary or desirable to carry out these powers;\n\n10. To perform all other acts that my Executor deems necessary or advisable for the proper administration of my estate.\n\n**C. Compensation**\n\nMy Executor shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for services rendered, as determined under Texas law.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VII: GUARDIAN NOMINATION\n\nThis provision is included for completeness, though my Child is believed to be an adult. If at the time of my death any of my Children are minors, I nominate and appoint **[GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as guardian of the person and estate of my minor Children. If **[GUARDIAN NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate guardian.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any guardian nominated herein.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VIII: NO-CONTEST CLAUSE\n\nIf any beneficiary under this Will contests or attacks this Will or any of its provisions, or aids or participates in any proceeding to contest or attack this Will or any of its provisions, any share or interest given to that contesting beneficiary under this Will is revoked and shall be disposed of as if that contesting beneficiary had predeceased me without descendants.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IX: TAX PROVISIONS\n\nAll estate, inheritance, succession, and other death taxes (including interest and penalties thereon) payable by reason of my death, whether attributable to property passing under this Will or otherwise, shall be paid out of my residuary estate without apportionment and without right of reimbursement from any person.\n\n\n## ARTICLE X: ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n**A. Definitions**\n\nAny reference to a statute or law shall include any amendments or successor provisions. When the context requires, words in the singular shall include the plural, and words in the plural shall include the singular.\n\n**B. Survivorship**\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Will, if any beneficiary and I die under circumstances where it is difficult or impossible to determine who died first, or if any beneficiary dies within forty-five (45) days after my death, that beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased me.\n\n**C. Governing Law**\n\nThis Will shall be construed and administered under the laws of the State of Texas.\n\n\n## ARTICLE XI: ORGAN DONATION\n\nI do **not** wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n## SIGNATURE AND ATTESTATION\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have subscribed my name to this Last Will and Testament this _____ day of ______________, 20___, declaring and publishing this instrument as my Last Will and Testament, in the presence of the undersigned witnesses, who witnessed and subscribed this Last Will and Testament at my request, and in my presence.\n\n\nSignature: ________________________________________\n\nPrint Name: William Dinkleberry\n\nDate: ________________________________________\n\n\n## ATTESTATION OF WITNESSES\n\nWe, the undersigned witnesses, each do hereby declare and attest that:\n\n1.

estate tax: The 2026 federal estate tax exemption is $13,990,000 per individual ($27,980,000 for married couples with portability). William's $3.5M estate is well below this threshold, resulting in zero federal estate tax liability. However, the exemption is scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2025, potentially reverting to approximately $7M per person in 2026 (inflation-adjusted). Even under reduced exemption, William's estate remains below the threshold. State estate tax: Texas has no state estate tax or inheritance tax. Texas repealed its state estate tax effective January 1, 2005.

Given William's age (67) and substantial assets ($3.5M), this is an immediate vulnerability that could result in financial disruption during a medical crisis.\",\"consequences\":\"Texas requires court-appointed guardianship of the estate under Texas Estates Code Title 3 if no POA exists. This involves filing a guardianship application, court hearings, posting bond, annual accountings to the court, and ongoing court supervision. The process typically takes 2-4 months and costs $5,000-$15,000 initially, plus $2,000-$5,000 annually for required accountings. Family members would need court permission for routine financial decisions.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":250,\"high\":500},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must be signed by principal, witnessed by one adult witness who is not the agent (Texas Estates Code §751.0021). Notarization is not required but strongly recommended. Durable language must state the authority survives incapacity.\"},{\"document\":\"Medical Power of Attorney (Healthcare Proxy)\",\"priority\":\"critical\",\"reason\":\"William has specified 'all measures' for life support but has no legal document authorizing anyone to make healthcare decisions if he's incapacitated. At age 67, the statistical likelihood of temporary or permanent incapacity increases significantly. Without this document, medical providers cannot legally accept Margaret's healthcare decisions without guardianship proceedings.\",\"consequences\":\"Texas requires guardianship of the person under Texas Estates Code Title 3 for healthcare decision-making without a Medical POA. Healthcare providers must obtain court orders for major medical procedures, potentially delaying critical treatment during emergencies. Guardianship proceedings cost $5,000-$12,000 and take weeks to months. Family conflict can arise over who should be appointed guardian, especially with adult children involved.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":200,\"high\":400},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must be in writing, signed by principal or another person in principal's presence by principal's direction, and witnessed by two competent adults (Texas Health and Safety Code §166.164). At least one witness cannot be a beneficiary or healthcare provider. Agent must sign acceptance of appointment.\"},{\"document\":\"Revocable Living Trust\",\"priority\":\"high\",\"reason\":\"With a $3.5M estate including a primary home ($500K-$1M), substantial bank accounts ($1M-$2M), and investment accounts ($250K-$500K), a revocable living trust would avoid probate entirely. Texas probate is required for assets over $75,000 not passing by beneficiary designation or joint ownership. The trust would provide privacy, avoid probate delays (typically 6-12 months in Texas), and ensure seamless asset management if William becomes incapacitated.\",\"consequences\":\"Without a trust, the estate faces mandatory probate under Texas Estates Code Chapter 301. Even with a valid Will ('independent administration'), probate costs include court filing fees ($300-$500), publication costs ($200-$400), appraisal fees (0.5-1% of estate value = $17,500-$35,000), and attorney fees (typically 3-5% of estate value = $105,000-$175,000). The estate remains frozen during probate, preventing asset distribution for 6-12+ months. Estate details become public record.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":2500,\"high\":5000},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must be in writing, signed by grantor, and notarized (Texas Property Code §112.001). Assets must be formally retitled into the trust name. Real property transfer requires deed execution with two witnesses or acknowledgment, recorded in county property records. Financial accounts require trust certification documents.\"},{\"document\":\"HIPAA Authorization\",\"priority\":\"medium\",\"reason\":\"Federal HIPAA privacy rules prevent healthcare providers from disclosing William's medical information to family members, including Margaret, without specific written authorization. Even with a Medical POA, providers often require separate HIPAA authorization for information disclosure. This document ensures Margaret and designated family members can obtain medical records, speak with physicians, and coordinate care during any medical situation.\",\"consequences\":\"Without HIPAA authorization, healthcare providers may refuse to discuss William's condition, test results, or treatment options with Margaret or family members, citing federal privacy violations (45 CFR §164.502). This creates dangerous information gaps during medical emergencies and prevents coordinated care among multiple providers. Providers face penalties up to $50,000 per violation for unauthorized disclosures, making them extremely cautious without proper authorization.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":100,\"high\":250},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must comply with 45 CFR §164.508 requirements: written in plain language, identify covered entities, describe information to be disclosed, identify persons authorized to receive information, expiration date or event, purpose of disclosure, and signed by individual with date. Texas law does not impose additional requirements beyond federal HIPAA standards.\"},{\"document\":\"Directive to Physicians (Living Will)\",\"priority\":\"medium\",\"reason\":\"While William stated preference for 'all measures' regarding life support, Texas law requires a specific statutory form to ensure these wishes are legally binding. Without this document, physicians may be uncertain about terminal care preferences, and family members may face agonizing decisions without clear legal guidance. At age 67, having clear end-of-life instructions documented properly protects both William's autonomy and his family from difficult decision-making.\",\"consequences\":\"Without a Directive to Physicians, healthcare providers must follow default protocols and family consensus, which may not align with William's wishes. Texas law (Health and Safety Code §166.033) protects physicians who follow a valid directive but provides less protection when following verbal family instructions. Family disputes over life support can result in costly court battles (guardianship or declaratory judgment proceedings costing $10,000-$50,000) and prolonged legal conflicts during the most emotionally difficult times.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":150,\"high\":350},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must be in writing, signed by declarant or another person at declarant's direction in declarant's presence, and witnessed by two competent adults (Texas Health and Safety Code §166.033). At least one witness cannot be a beneficiary, attending physician, or healthcare facility employee. Must substantially follow statutory form provided in Section 166.033.\"},{\"document\":\"Special Needs Trust for Parents\",\"priority\":\"medium\",\"reason\":\"William indicated both parents are living and care is needed. If parents receive or may receive Medicaid, SSI, or other means-tested government benefits, direct inheritance from William's estate could disqualify them from these critical benefits. A properly structured third-party special needs trust would allow William to provide for parents' supplemental needs without jeopardizing their public benefits eligibility.\",\"consequences\":\"If William's Will or estate plan provides direct distributions to parents who receive Medicaid or SSI, the inheritance would count as countable resources, immediately disqualifying them from benefits until assets are spent down to eligibility limits ($2,000 for individuals in Texas). Loss of Medicaid could leave parents without healthcare coverage or force them to private-pay for nursing home care ($5,000-$8,000/month). Requalification requires spending down inherited assets and reapplying, creating a gap in coverage.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":1500,\"high\":3500},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must be irrevocable third-party trust (not self-settled) to preserve Medicaid eligibility under 42 USC §1396p(d)(4). Trust language must include sole benefit provision, discretionary distributions standard, and prohibition on direct beneficiary access. Trustee must be someone other than beneficiary. Must comply with Texas Trust Code provisions (Texas Property Code Title 9). Should be reviewed by elder law attorney for Medicaid compliance.\"}]","outdatedDocuments":"[]","rawAnalysis":"\nadded 5 packages in 2s\n\n4 packages are looking for funding\n  run `npm fund` for details\n=== Starting Claude Code ===\nWorking directory: /home/user/generated\nAvailable skills:\ntotal 24\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 user user 4096 Jan 15 21:31 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 user user 4096 Jan 15 21:31 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jan 15 21:31 estate-document-analyzer\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jan 15 21:31 estate-goals-profiler\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jan 15 21:31 financial-profile-classifier\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jan 15 21:31 us-estate-planning-analyzer\n{\"type\":\"result\",\"subtype\":\"success\",\"is_error\":false,\"duration_ms\":379506,\"duration_api_ms\":379223,\"num_turns\":2,\"result\":\"I've created a comprehensive Texas estate planning analysis for William Dinkleberry at `/home/user/generated/analysis.json`.\\n\\n## Key Findings:\\n\\n**Overall Score: 72/C** - While William has a Will, critical gaps exist that expose him and his family to significant financial and legal risks.\\n\\n### Most Critical Issues:\\n\\n1. **No Powers of Attorney** - Both Financial and Healthcare POAs are missing.

This is particularly valuable given William's estate is not at risk for federal estate tax but could benefit from controlled wealth transfer.\",\"estimatedSavings\":{\"low\":15000,\"high\":45000},\"savingsNote\":\"Estimated savings based on reducing estate size by $200,000-$500,000 over 5-10 years, avoiding probate costs of 4-6.5% on those amounts plus providing liquidity to family members during William's lifetime for tax planning and education funding.\",\"implementationSteps\":[\"Identify all potential gift recipients: Ben (son), Hannah Whitaker (dependent), parents if living, and potentially future grandchildren\",\"Establish annual gifting calendar with reminders before year-end to maximize exclusion amounts\",\"Document all gifts with gift letters and bank transfer records, even though below reporting threshold\",\"Consider gifting appreciated assets (investment holdings) to Ben or other family members in lower tax brackets, who can sell with lower capital gains tax exposure\",\"Coordinate with accountant to track cumulative gifts and ensure no inadvertent gift tax filing requirements\",\"Review and adjust strategy annually based on changes to gift tax exclusion amounts (indexed for inflation)\"]},{\"strategy\":\"Spousal Lifetime Access Trust (SLAT)\",\"applicability\":\"With potential sunset of increased estate tax exemption after 2025, William should consider transferring assets to an irrevocable trust for Margaret's benefit before exemption reduces. Current exemption ($13.99M) provides opportunity to remove up to $2-3M from William's estate while maintaining indirect access through Margaret's distributions. This is particularly strategic for William's substantial investment and bank accounts ($1.25M-$2.5M combined), protecting against future estate tax law changes.\",\"estimatedSavings\":{\"low\":800000,\"high\":1200000},\"savingsNote\":\"If estate tax exemption reverts to $7M (inflation-adjusted) in 2026 and William's estate grows to $5-7M over time, a SLAT funded now could remove $2M from estate, saving 40% estate tax on that amount if estate ultimately exceeds exemption. Even without estate tax, removes assets from future probate exposure (4-6.5% savings). Growth inside SLAT also removed from estate.\",\"implementationSteps\":[\"Consult with estate planning attorney specializing in irrevocable trusts before December 31, 2025 to utilize current high exemption\",\"Determine optimal funding amount (recommend $1.5M-$2.5M based on current asset levels and maintaining adequate liquidity)\",\"Draft SLAT with independent trustee (not William), providing discretionary distributions to Margaret and descendants\",\"Include trust protector provision to allow modifications for changed circumstances or tax law\",\"Fund trust with non-retirement assets (investment accounts, bank accounts, or appreciated securities) - never fund with IRAs or 401(k)s\",\"File Form 709 Gift Tax Return reporting gift and claiming exemption allocation\",\"Coordinate with Margaret to potentially establish reciprocal SLAT with different terms to avoid reciprocal trust doctrine\"]},{\"strategy\":\"Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD) Strategy\",\"applicability\":\"William is 67 years old and will reach age 70½ in 2028, making him eligible for QCDs from his Roth IRA and 403(b) accounts. He has expressed charitable intent (10% to 'Kai Cenat stream', though this may require clarification on qualified charity status). QCDs allow direct transfers from IRA to qualified charity (up to $105,000 annually in 2026), satisfying Required Minimum Distributions without increasing adjusted gross income. This reduces taxable estate while fulfilling charitable objectives.\",\"estimatedSavings\":{\"low\":8000,\"high\":25000},\"savingsNote\":\"Assuming retirement accounts valued at $300,000-$500,000, annual RMDs starting at age 73 would be $11,000-$18,000. Using QCD for charitable giving saves income tax at marginal rate (likely 24-32% = $2,640-$5,760 annually) plus reduces MAGI, potentially avoiding Medicare IRMAA surcharges ($2,000-$6,000 annually) and reducing estate size for probate cost purposes.\",\"implementationSteps\":[\"Verify qualified charity status of intended recipients - 'Kai Cenat stream' may not be qualified 501(c)(3); identify appropriate charities aligned with William's values\",\"Upon reaching age 70½ (2028), contact IRA custodians for 403(b) and Roth IRA to establish QCD procedures\",\"Request direct transfer from IRA custodian to qualified charity (never take distribution personally, then donate - this doesn't qualify)\",\"Obtain written acknowledgment from charity for transfers over $250 as required by IRS\",\"Coordinate QCD timing with RMD requirements starting at age 73 (2031) to satisfy distribution requirements tax-free\",\"Do not claim charitable deduction on tax return for QCD amounts (already excluded from income)\",\"Review strategy annually with tax advisor to optimize QCD amounts based on RMD requirements and charitable goals\"]},{\"strategy\":\"Beneficiary Designation Audit and Roth Conversion Strategy\",\"applicability\":\"William has Roth IRA and 403(b) accounts but data indicates no beneficiary designations are documented. Retirement accounts pass outside probate via beneficiary designation, but missing designations force accounts into probate estate. Additionally, systematic conversions of traditional 403(b) funds to Roth IRA while in current tax bracket (before RMDs begin) creates tax-free growth and eliminates beneficiaries' future income tax burden. With adult son Ben, stretch IRA rules under SECURE Act require distribution within 10 years, making Roth conversions highly valuable.\",\"estimatedSavings\":{\"low\":35000,\"high\":85000},\"savingsNote\":\"Avoiding probate on retirement accounts (estimated $300,000-$500,000) saves 4-6.5% in probate costs = $12,000-$32,500. Roth conversions during lower-income years (post-retirement, before RMDs and Social Security) at 22-24% rate versus beneficiary withdrawals at potentially 32-35% rate saves $30,000-$52,500 over beneficiary's 10-year distribution period on $300,000 account balance.\",\"implementationSteps\":[\"Immediately contact all retirement account custodians (403(b) and Roth IRA) to verify current beneficiary designations\",\"Update all accounts with primary beneficiary: Margaret Louise Dinkleberry; contingent beneficiaries: Ben Dinkleberry, Andrew Thomas Dinkleberry, Claire Elizabeth Dinkleberry in equal shares per stirpes\",\"Review titling of all bank and investment accounts ($1M-$2M) to ensure proper joint ownership with right of survivorship or payable-on-death (POD) designations\",\"Analyze annual Roth conversion opportunities from 403(b) to Roth IRA - convert amounts that fill current tax bracket without pushing into higher bracket\",\"Perform conversions during low-income years (after retirement, before Social Security claiming at 70, before RMDs)\",\"Pay conversion taxes from non-retirement accounts to preserve maximum Roth balance for tax-free growth\",\"Model long-term tax impact with CPA including Medicare IRMAA brackets and Social Security taxation thresholds\",\"Consider front-loading larger Roth conversions if healthcare needs arise while in lower tax brackets\"]},{\"strategy\":\"Step-Up in Basis Planning for Appreciated Assets\",\"applicability\":\"William owns primary home ($500K-$1M), investment accounts ($250K-$500K), and personal property including 2019 Dodge Hellcat with likely appreciated value. Under current tax law, assets passing at death receive step-up in cost basis to fair market value at death (IRC §1014), eliminating built-in capital gains. Strategic planning ensures appreciated assets pass at death rather than gifted during lifetime, and ensures Margaret receives full step-up on community property assets under Texas community property laws.\",\"estimatedSavings\":{\"low\":50000,\"high\":150000},\"savingsNote\":\"Assuming primary home purchased for $300,000 now worth $750,000 = $450,000 gain. Investment accounts with $200,000 basis now worth $400,000 = $200,000 gain. Total appreciation $650,000. At death, full step-up eliminates capital gains tax. If sold by Margaret or heirs immediately after death, $0 tax versus $97,500-$130,000 (15-20% LTCG rate) if gifted during lifetime and later sold. Texas community property law provides step-up on 100% of community assets, not just decedent's 50%.\",\"implementationSteps\":[\"Identify all appreciated assets and document original cost basis - primary residence, investment securities, vehicles (Dodge Hellcat), collectibles (vinyl records, audio equipment)\",\"Avoid gifting highly appreciated assets during lifetime - use annual exclusion gifts with low-basis assets or cash instead\",\"Ensure all assets are properly characterized as community property under Texas law to obtain full step-up on both halves at first death\",\"Consider community property agreement or declaration confirming character of assets acquired during marriage\",\"Maintain detailed records of all asset purchases, improvements (particularly home renovations), and capital contributions\",\"For investment accounts, keep all brokerage statements showing purchase dates and amounts to establish basis for heirs\",\"Instruct executor (Margaret, then Ben) to obtain formal appraisals at date of death for all significant assets to establish stepped-up basis\",\"Advise heirs not to sell appreciated assets immediately before death to preserve opportunity for step-up\"]}]"},"name":"My Estate Plan","sessionId":"session_1768425733075_h7xrdf","status":"analysis_complete","updatedAt":1768513074886}

To perform all other acts that my Executor deems necessary or advisable for the proper administration of my estate.\n\n**C. Compensation**\n\nMy Executor shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for services rendered, as determined under Texas law.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VII: GUARDIAN NOMINATION\n\nThis provision is included for completeness, though my Child is believed to be an adult. If at the time of my death any of my Children are minors, I nominate and appoint **[GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as guardian of the person and estate of my minor Children. If **[GUARDIAN NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate guardian.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any guardian nominated herein.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VIII: NO-CONTEST CLAUSE\n\nIf any beneficiary under this Will contests or attacks this Will or any of its provisions, or aids or participates in any proceeding to contest or attack this Will or any of its provisions, any share or interest given to that contesting beneficiary under this Will is revoked and shall be disposed of as if that contesting beneficiary had predeceased me without descendants.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IX: TAX PROVISIONS\n\nAll estate, inheritance, succession, and other death taxes (including interest and penalties thereon) payable by reason of my death, whether attributable to property passing under this Will or otherwise, shall be paid out of my residuary estate without apportionment and without right of reimbursement from any person.\n\n\n## ARTICLE X: ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n**A.

However, the exemption is scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2025, potentially reverting to approximately $7M per person in 2026 (inflation-adjusted). Even under reduced exemption, William's estate remains below the threshold. State estate tax: Texas has no state estate tax or inheritance tax.

Given William's age (67) and substantial assets ($3.5M), this is an immediate vulnerability that could result in financial disruption during a medical crisis.\",\"consequences\":\"Texas requires court-appointed guardianship of the estate under Texas Estates Code Title 3 if no POA exists. This involves filing a guardianship application, court hearings, posting bond, annual accountings to the court, and ongoing court supervision. The process typically takes 2-4 months and costs $5,000-$15,000 initially, plus $2,000-$5,000 annually for required accountings.

At age 67, the statistical likelihood of temporary or permanent incapacity increases significantly. Without this document, medical providers cannot legally accept Margaret's healthcare decisions without guardianship proceedings.\",\"consequences\":\"Texas requires guardianship of the person under Texas Estates Code Title 3 for healthcare decision-making without a Medical POA. Healthcare providers must obtain court orders for major medical procedures, potentially delaying critical treatment during emergencies. Guardianship proceedings cost $5,000-$12,000 and take weeks to months.

Texas probate is required for assets over $75,000 not passing by beneficiary designation or joint ownership. The trust would provide privacy, avoid probate delays (typically 6-12 months in Texas), and ensure seamless asset management if William becomes incapacitated.\",\"consequences\":\"Without a trust, the estate faces mandatory probate under Texas Estates Code Chapter 301. Even with a valid Will ('independent administration'), probate costs include court filing fees ($300-$500), publication costs ($200-$400), appraisal fees (0.5-1% of estate value = $17,500-$35,000), and attorney fees (typically 3-5% of estate value = $105,000-$175,000). The estate remains frozen during probate, preventing asset distribution for 6-12+ months. Estate details become public record.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":2500,\"high\":5000},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must be in writing, signed by grantor, and notarized (Texas Property Code §112.001). Assets must be formally retitled into the trust name. Real property transfer requires deed execution with two witnesses or acknowledgment, recorded in county property records. Financial accounts require trust certification documents.\"},{\"document\":\"HIPAA Authorization\",\"priority\":\"medium\",\"reason\":\"Federal HIPAA privacy rules prevent healthcare providers from disclosing William's medical information to family members, including Margaret, without specific written authorization. Even with a Medical POA, providers often require separate HIPAA authorization for information disclosure. This document ensures Margaret and designated family members can obtain medical records, speak with physicians, and coordinate care during any medical situation.\",\"consequences\":\"Without HIPAA authorization, healthcare providers may refuse to discuss William's condition, test results, or treatment options with Margaret or family members, citing federal privacy violations (45 CFR §164.502). This creates dangerous information gaps during medical emergencies and prevents coordinated care among multiple providers. Providers face penalties up to $50,000 per violation for unauthorized disclosures, making them extremely cautious without proper authorization.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":100,\"high\":250},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must comply with 45 CFR §164.508 requirements: written in plain language, identify covered entities, describe information to be disclosed, identify persons authorized to receive information, expiration date or event, purpose of disclosure, and signed by individual with date. Texas law does not impose additional requirements beyond federal HIPAA standards.\"},{\"document\":\"Directive to Physicians (Living Will)\",\"priority\":\"medium\",\"reason\":\"While William stated preference for 'all measures' regarding life support, Texas law requires a specific statutory form to ensure these wishes are legally binding. Without this document, physicians may be uncertain about terminal care preferences, and family members may face agonizing decisions without clear legal guidance. At age 67, having clear end-of-life instructions documented properly protects both William's autonomy and his family from difficult decision-making.\",\"consequences\":\"Without a Directive to Physicians, healthcare providers must follow default protocols and family consensus, which may not align with William's wishes. Texas law (Health and Safety Code §166.033) protects physicians who follow a valid directive but provides less protection when following verbal family instructions. Family disputes over life support can result in costly court battles (guardianship or declaratory judgment proceedings costing $10,000-$50,000) and prolonged legal conflicts during the most emotionally difficult times.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":150,\"high\":350},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must be in writing, signed by declarant or another person at declarant's direction in declarant's presence, and witnessed by two competent adults (Texas Health and Safety Code §166.033). At least one witness cannot be a beneficiary, attending physician, or healthcare facility employee. Must substantially follow statutory form provided in Section 166.033.\"},{\"document\":\"Special Needs Trust for Parents\",\"priority\":\"medium\",\"reason\":\"William indicated both parents are living and care is needed. If parents receive or may receive Medicaid, SSI, or other means-tested government benefits, direct inheritance from William's estate could disqualify them from these critical benefits. A properly structured third-party special needs trust would allow William to provide for parents' supplemental needs without jeopardizing their public benefits eligibility.\",\"consequences\":\"If William's Will or estate plan provides direct distributions to parents who receive Medicaid or SSI, the inheritance would count as countable resources, immediately disqualifying them from benefits until assets are spent down to eligibility limits ($2,000 for individuals in Texas). Loss of Medicaid could leave parents without healthcare coverage or force them to private-pay for nursing home care ($5,000-$8,000/month). Requalification requires spending down inherited assets and reapplying, creating a gap in coverage.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":1500,\"high\":3500},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must be irrevocable third-party trust (not self-settled) to preserve Medicaid eligibility under 42 USC §1396p(d)(4).

This draft is not a substitute for professional legal advice.**\n\n\n## ARTICLE I: DECLARATION AND IDENTIFICATION\n\nI, **William Dinkleberry**, a resident of 742 Evergreen Bluff Drive, Cedar Ridge, Texas 77082, in [COUNTY] County, Texas, being of sound mind and legal age, do hereby make, publish, and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby expressly revoking all prior wills and codicils heretofore made by me.\n\nI was born on December 31, 1958, and am currently married.\n\n\n## ARTICLE II: FAMILY STATUS\n\nI am married to **Margaret Dinkleberry** (\"my Spouse\").\n\nI have one child: **Ben Dingleberry** (\"my Child\").\n\nAny reference in this Will to \"my Children\" shall include the above-named child and any children hereafter born to or legally adopted by me.\n\n\n## ARTICLE III: SPECIFIC BEQUESTS\n\nI give, devise, and bequeath the following specific bequests to the named beneficiaries, provided that each beneficiary survives me by at least forty-five (45) days:\n\nA.

If my Spouse, **Margaret Dinkleberry**, survives me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Spouse outright and free of trust.\n\nB. If my Spouse does not survive me by at least forty-five (45) days, I give my entire residuary estate to my Child, **Ben Dingleberry**, or if my Child does not survive me, then to my Child's descendants, per stirpes.\n\nC. For purposes of this Will, a person shall be deemed to have survived me only if such person is living on the forty-fifth (45th) day after my death.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VI: EXECUTOR APPOINTMENT AND POWERS\n\n**A. Appointment of Executor**\n\nI nominate and appoint **[PRIMARY EXECUTOR NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** to serve as Executor of this Will.

To employ attorneys, accountants, investment advisors, and other professionals, and to pay their reasonable compensation from estate assets;\n\n6. To settle, compromise, or contest claims in favor of or against my estate;\n\n7.

To operate, maintain, or discontinue any business interest owned by me at the time of my death;\n\n9. To execute and deliver any instruments necessary or desirable to carry out these powers;\n\n10. To perform all other acts that my Executor deems necessary or advisable for the proper administration of my estate.\n\n**C. Compensation**\n\nMy Executor shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for services rendered, as determined under Texas law.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VII: GUARDIAN NOMINATION\n\nThis provision is included for completeness, though my Child is believed to be an adult. If at the time of my death any of my Children are minors, I nominate and appoint **[GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as guardian of the person and estate of my minor Children. If **[GUARDIAN NAME]** is unable or unwilling to serve, I nominate and appoint **[ALTERNATE GUARDIAN NAME AND RELATIONSHIP]** as alternate guardian.\n\nI request that no bond or other security be required of any guardian nominated herein.\n\n\n## ARTICLE VIII: NO-CONTEST CLAUSE\n\nIf any beneficiary under this Will contests or attacks this Will or any of its provisions, or aids or participates in any proceeding to contest or attack this Will or any of its provisions, any share or interest given to that contesting beneficiary under this Will is revoked and shall be disposed of as if that contesting beneficiary had predeceased me without descendants.\n\n\n## ARTICLE IX: TAX PROVISIONS\n\nAll estate, inheritance, succession, and other death taxes (including interest and penalties thereon) payable by reason of my death, whether attributable to property passing under this Will or otherwise, shall be paid out of my residuary estate without apportionment and without right of reimbursement from any person.\n\n\n## ARTICLE X: ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n**A. Definitions**\n\nAny reference to a statute or law shall include any amendments or successor provisions. When the context requires, words in the singular shall include the plural, and words in the plural shall include the singular.\n\n**B. Survivorship**\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Will, if any beneficiary and I die under circumstances where it is difficult or impossible to determine who died first, or if any beneficiary dies within forty-five (45) days after my death, that beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased me.\n\n**C. Governing Law**\n\nThis Will shall be construed and administered under the laws of the State of Texas.\n\n\n## ARTICLE XI: ORGAN DONATION\n\nI do **not** wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n## SIGNATURE AND ATTESTATION\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have subscribed my name to this Last Will and Testament this _____ day of ______________, 20___, declaring and publishing this instrument as my Last Will and Testament, in the presence of the undersigned witnesses, who witnessed and subscribed this Last Will and Testament at my request, and in my presence.\n\n\nSignature: ________________________________________\n\nPrint Name: William Dinkleberry\n\nDate: ________________________________________\n\n\n## ATTESTATION OF WITNESSES\n\nWe, the undersigned witnesses, each do hereby declare and attest that:\n\n1.

estate tax: The 2026 federal estate tax exemption is $13,990,000 per individual ($27,980,000 for married couples with portability). William's $3.5M estate is well below this threshold, resulting in zero federal estate tax liability. However, the exemption is scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2025, potentially reverting to approximately $7M per person in 2026 (inflation-adjusted). Even under reduced exemption, William's estate remains below the threshold. State estate tax: Texas has no state estate tax or inheritance tax. Texas repealed its state estate tax effective January 1, 2005. Total estate tax exposure: $0 under current law and foreseeable changes.\"}","inconsistencies":"[]","missingDocuments":"[{\"document\":\"Financial Power of Attorney (Durable)\",\"priority\":\"critical\",\"reason\":\"Without this document, if William becomes incapacitated, Margaret and family members cannot access bank accounts, manage investments, pay bills, or handle financial affairs without court intervention. Given William's age (67) and substantial assets ($3.5M), this is an immediate vulnerability that could result in financial disruption during a medical crisis.\",\"consequences\":\"Texas requires court-appointed guardianship of the estate under Texas Estates Code Title 3 if no POA exists. This involves filing a guardianship application, court hearings, posting bond, annual accountings to the court, and ongoing court supervision. The process typically takes 2-4 months and costs $5,000-$15,000 initially, plus $2,000-$5,000 annually for required accountings. Family members would need court permission for routine financial decisions.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":250,\"high\":500},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must be signed by principal, witnessed by one adult witness who is not the agent (Texas Estates Code §751.0021). Notarization is not required but strongly recommended. Durable language must state the authority survives incapacity.\"},{\"document\":\"Medical Power of Attorney (Healthcare Proxy)\",\"priority\":\"critical\",\"reason\":\"William has specified 'all measures' for life support but has no legal document authorizing anyone to make healthcare decisions if he's incapacitated. At age 67, the statistical likelihood of temporary or permanent incapacity increases significantly. Without this document, medical providers cannot legally accept Margaret's healthcare decisions without guardianship proceedings.\",\"consequences\":\"Texas requires guardianship of the person under Texas Estates Code Title 3 for healthcare decision-making without a Medical POA. Healthcare providers must obtain court orders for major medical procedures, potentially delaying critical treatment during emergencies. Guardianship proceedings cost $5,000-$12,000 and take weeks to months. Family conflict can arise over who should be appointed guardian, especially with adult children involved.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":200,\"high\":400},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must be in writing, signed by principal or another person in principal's presence by principal's direction, and witnessed by two competent adults (Texas Health and Safety Code §166.164). At least one witness cannot be a beneficiary or healthcare provider. Agent must sign acceptance of appointment.\"},{\"document\":\"Revocable Living Trust\",\"priority\":\"high\",\"reason\":\"With a $3.5M estate including a primary home ($500K-$1M), substantial bank accounts ($1M-$2M), and investment accounts ($250K-$500K), a revocable living trust would avoid probate entirely. Texas probate is required for assets over $75,000 not passing by beneficiary designation or joint ownership. The trust would provide privacy, avoid probate delays (typically 6-12 months in Texas), and ensure seamless asset management if William becomes incapacitated.\",\"consequences\":\"Without a trust, the estate faces mandatory probate under Texas Estates Code Chapter 301. Even with a valid Will ('independent administration'), probate costs include court filing fees ($300-$500), publication costs ($200-$400), appraisal fees (0.5-1% of estate value = $17,500-$35,000), and attorney fees (typically 3-5% of estate value = $105,000-$175,000). The estate remains frozen during probate, preventing asset distribution for 6-12+ months. Estate details become public record.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":2500,\"high\":5000},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must be in writing, signed by grantor, and notarized (Texas Property Code §112.001). Assets must be formally retitled into the trust name. Real property transfer requires deed execution with two witnesses or acknowledgment, recorded in county property records. Financial accounts require trust certification documents.\"},{\"document\":\"HIPAA Authorization\",\"priority\":\"medium\",\"reason\":\"Federal HIPAA privacy rules prevent healthcare providers from disclosing William's medical information to family members, including Margaret, without specific written authorization. Even with a Medical POA, providers often require separate HIPAA authorization for information disclosure. This document ensures Margaret and designated family members can obtain medical records, speak with physicians, and coordinate care during any medical situation.\",\"consequences\":\"Without HIPAA authorization, healthcare providers may refuse to discuss William's condition, test results, or treatment options with Margaret or family members, citing federal privacy violations (45 CFR §164.502). This creates dangerous information gaps during medical emergencies and prevents coordinated care among multiple providers. Providers face penalties up to $50,000 per violation for unauthorized disclosures, making them extremely cautious without proper authorization.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":100,\"high\":250},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must comply with 45 CFR §164.508 requirements: written in plain language, identify covered entities, describe information to be disclosed, identify persons authorized to receive information, expiration date or event, purpose of disclosure, and signed by individual with date. Texas law does not impose additional requirements beyond federal HIPAA standards.\"},{\"document\":\"Directive to Physicians (Living Will)\",\"priority\":\"medium\",\"reason\":\"While William stated preference for 'all measures' regarding life support, Texas law requires a specific statutory form to ensure these wishes are legally binding. Without this document, physicians may be uncertain about terminal care preferences, and family members may face agonizing decisions without clear legal guidance. At age 67, having clear end-of-life instructions documented properly protects both William's autonomy and his family from difficult decision-making.\",\"consequences\":\"Without a Directive to Physicians, healthcare providers must follow default protocols and family consensus, which may not align with William's wishes. Texas law (Health and Safety Code §166.033) protects physicians who follow a valid directive but provides less protection when following verbal family instructions. Family disputes over life support can result in costly court battles (guardianship or declaratory judgment proceedings costing $10,000-$50,000) and prolonged legal conflicts during the most emotionally difficult times.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":150,\"high\":350},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must be in writing, signed by declarant or another person at declarant's direction in declarant's presence, and witnessed by two competent adults (Texas Health and Safety Code §166.033). At least one witness cannot be a beneficiary, attending physician, or healthcare facility employee. Must substantially follow statutory form provided in Section 166.033.\"},{\"document\":\"Special Needs Trust for Parents\",\"priority\":\"medium\",\"reason\":\"William indicated both parents are living and care is needed. If parents receive or may receive Medicaid, SSI, or other means-tested government benefits, direct inheritance from William's estate could disqualify them from these critical benefits. A properly structured third-party special needs trust would allow William to provide for parents' supplemental needs without jeopardizing their public benefits eligibility.\",\"consequences\":\"If William's Will or estate plan provides direct distributions to parents who receive Medicaid or SSI, the inheritance would count as countable resources, immediately disqualifying them from benefits until assets are spent down to eligibility limits ($2,000 for individuals in Texas). Loss of Medicaid could leave parents without healthcare coverage or force them to private-pay for nursing home care ($5,000-$8,000/month). Requalification requires spending down inherited assets and reapplying, creating a gap in coverage.\",\"estimatedCostToCreate\":{\"low\":1500,\"high\":3500},\"stateRequirements\":\"Must be irrevocable third-party trust (not self-settled) to preserve Medicaid eligibility under 42 USC §1396p(d)(4). Trust language must include sole benefit provision, discretionary distributions standard, and prohibition on direct beneficiary access. Trustee must be someone other than beneficiary. Must comply with Texas Trust Code provisions (Texas Property Code Title 9). Should be reviewed by elder law attorney for Medicaid compliance.\"}]","outdatedDocuments":"[]","rawAnalysis":"\nadded 5 packages in 2s\n\n4 packages are looking for funding\n  run `npm fund` for details\n=== Starting Claude Code ===\nWorking directory: /home/user/generated\nAvailable skills:\ntotal 24\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 user user 4096 Jan 15 21:31 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 user user 4096 Jan 15 21:31 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jan 15 21:31 estate-document-analyzer\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jan 15 21:31 estate-goals-profiler\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jan 15 21:31 financial-profile-classifier\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jan 15 21:31 us-estate-planning-analyzer\n{\"type\":\"result\",\"subtype\":\"success\",\"is_error\":false,\"duration_ms\":379506,\"duration_api_ms\":379223,\"num_turns\":2,\"result\":\"I've created a comprehensive Texas estate planning analysis for William Dinkleberry at `/home/user/generated/analysis.json`.\\n\\n## Key Findings:\\n\\n**Overall Score: 72/C** - While William has a Will, critical gaps exist that expose him and his family to significant financial and legal risks.\\n\\n### Most Critical Issues:\\n\\n1. **No Powers of Attorney** - Both Financial and Healthcare POAs are missing.
