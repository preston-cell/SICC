## Demo Flow

### Part 1: Introduction (30 seconds)

**Narrator Script:**
> "Today I'll show you EstateAI, an AI-powered platform that makes estate planning as simple as having a conversation. We'll see two key features: creating a new will through natural dialogue, and our unique import-and-improve capability for existing documents."

### Part 2: New Will Creation (2-3 minutes)

**Action:** Start new will conversation

**Narrator Script:**
> "Let's start by creating a simple will. Instead of filling out forms, we'll just have a conversation."

**Key Points to Highlight:**
1. Natural, adaptive questions
2. Plain-language explanations when needed
3. Follow-up questions based on answers
4. Confirmation of critical details

**Sample Conversation Flow:**
1. "I want to create a will"
2. Answer basic questions (name, state, family)
3. Show how it adapts to family situation
4. Quick asset overview
5. Executor nomination with explanation

**Narrator Script (during):**
> "Notice how the questions adapt based on my answers. When I mentioned I have young children, it immediately asked about guardianship. This isn't a rigid form - it's a real conversation."

### Part 3: Document Preview (1 minute)

**Action:** Show generated document preview

**Narrator Script:**
> "Once we've gathered the information, EstateAI generates a complete, state-specific will. Here's the preview with plain-English summaries of each section."

**Key Points to Highlight:**
1. Professional document formatting
2. State-specific clauses (California)
3. Plain-English summary alongside legal language
4. Execution instructions included

### Part 4: Import & Improve (2-3 minutes)

**Action:** Upload existing will document

**Narrator Script:**
> "Now let's look at our key differentiator. I have an existing will from several years ago. Let me upload it and see what EstateAI finds."

**Key Points to Highlight:**
1. Document upload and processing
2. Automatic element extraction
3. Gap analysis results
4. Specific recommendations
5. Option for targeted updates vs. full rewrite

**Sample Findings to Show:**
- "Your executor, John Smith, is still listed but you mentioned he passed away last year"
- "No digital assets clause - recommended for modern estate plans"
- "Guardian nomination doesn't include an alternate"
- "Document is 8 years old - life circumstances may have changed"

**Narrator Script (during):**
> "The AI has identified several gaps. Some are potential issues with the existing document, others are opportunities to modernize it. The key is that I don't need to start from scratch - I can just address these specific items."

### Part 5: Wrap-Up (30 seconds)

**Narrator Script:**
> "That's EstateAI - estate planning through natural conversation, with the ability to import and improve existing documents. We're making estate planning accessible, affordable, and actually completable."

## Handling Questions

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you ensure legal accuracy?**
> "We combine AI with a rules engine that contains state-specific legal requirements. Every document is validated against current law. For complex situations, we offer optional attorney review."

**Q: What states do you support?**
> "We're launching with California and expanding to Texas, Florida, and New York in phase 2. Our architecture supports all 50 states."

**Q: How is this different from LegalZoom?**
> "Three main differences: conversational AI instead of forms, our import-and-improve capability, and targeted pricing where you only pay for what you need."

**Q: What about complex estates?**
> "Our MVP focuses on simple to moderate estates. For complex situations with business interests, significant trusts, or tax planning needs, we recommend and can connect users with our attorney partner network."
