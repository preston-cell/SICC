## Demo Flow

### Part 1: Introduction & Problem Setup (45 seconds)

**Narrator Script:**
> "Meet Robert Chen — a successful professional with about $8 million in assets. Like many high-net-worth individuals, Robert has an estate plan. His attorney set it up back in 2016. But here's the problem..."

**Show:** Persona card or slide with Robert's profile

> "Robert knows his plan is probably outdated. His brother — who was named as successor trustee — passed away two years ago. He's acquired new properties. And he has no idea what else might be wrong.

> "But to find out, he'd have to engage an attorney for a comprehensive review — typically $5,000 to $15,000 — without knowing if anything actually needs fixing.

> "That's where EstateAI comes in."

### Part 2: Document Upload (1 minute)

**Action:** Show document upload interface

**Narrator Script:**
> "EstateAI lets Robert upload his existing estate planning documents — his trust, his will, his power of attorney — directly into our secure platform."

**Show:**
- Drag-and-drop upload
- Document type identification
- Encryption/security indicators

> "We support PDF and Word documents, including scanned copies. Everything is encrypted and handled with bank-level security — critical when dealing with sensitive estate documents."

**Show:** Documents uploaded:
- Chen Family Trust (2016) ✓
- Pour-over Will ✓
- Durable Power of Attorney ✓

> "Notice that Robert's uploaded his trust, will, and POA. We'll see in a moment that something important is missing."

### Part 3: Analysis Processing (30 seconds)

**Action:** Show analysis in progress (or skip if showing pre-completed)

**Narrator Script:**
> "Once uploaded, our AI gets to work. We're extracting key elements — beneficiaries, executors, trustees, assets mentioned. We're checking against California's specific legal requirements. And we're comparing to best practices to identify gaps."

**Show:** Progress indicator with steps:
- Extracting document structure...
- Identifying key elements...
- Checking state compliance...
- Detecting gaps...
- Generating report...

> "This typically takes 2–3 minutes. Let me show you what the finished analysis looks like."

### Part 4: Gap Report Walkthrough (2.5–3 minutes)

**Action:** Show completed gap report

**Narrator Script:**
> "Here's Robert's estate plan analysis report. Let's start with the executive summary."

**Show:** Executive summary
- Risk Score: 68/100
- Critical Issues: 1
- High Priority: 2
- Medium Priority: 3
- Advisory: 2

> "Robert's overall risk score is 68 out of 100 — meaning there are some significant issues to address. Let's look at what we found."

---

**Section: Critical Issues**

**Show:** Critical finding card

> "First, the critical issue. Remember how Robert mentioned his brother passed away? Well, his brother was named as successor trustee in his trust. If something happens to Robert and his wife, there's now a gap in who would manage the trust for their children. This needs immediate attention."

**Key Points:**
- What we found: Successor trustee (brother) appears to be deceased
- Why it matters: No valid successor if primary trustees incapacitated
- Recommended action: Amend trust to name new successor trustee

---

**Section: High Priority Issues**

**Show:** High priority finding cards

> "Next, we found two high-priority issues. First, Robert's trust was created in 2016 — before digital assets were commonly addressed in estate plans. There's no provision for his cryptocurrency holdings, his online accounts, or digital property. In today's world, that's a significant oversight."

> "Second — and this is something Robert didn't even realize — there's no healthcare proxy or advance directive in his document set. If Robert becomes incapacitated, there's no legal document authorizing anyone to make medical decisions for him. His family would have to go to court."

**Key Points:**
- Missing digital asset provisions
- Missing healthcare directive

---

**Section: Recommendations**

**Show:** Prioritized recommendations

> "Finally, we provide Robert with prioritized next steps. Address the critical successor trustee issue first. Then tackle the healthcare directive gap. Then update the trust for digital assets. We explain each in plain English — no legal jargon."

### Part 5: Attorney Connection (30 seconds)

**Action:** Show attorney referral option

**Narrator Script:**
> "Now Robert knows exactly what needs fixing. He's not walking into a lawyer's office blind. He can have a focused conversation about these specific issues."

> "If Robert wants help finding an attorney, we can connect him with vetted estate planning attorneys in his area who specialize in these types of updates. He's in control."

**Show:** "Find an Attorney" CTA

### Part 6: Wrap-up (30 seconds)

**Narrator Script:**
> "That's EstateAI. Professional-grade estate plan analysis, powered by AI, at a fraction of traditional legal review costs.

> "For high-net-worth individuals like Robert — people with real estate planning complexity but who can't justify $15,000 for a comprehensive attorney review — we provide clarity, priority, and peace of mind.

> "Know what's wrong before you walk into a lawyer's office."

## Handling Q&A

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: How accurate is the AI analysis?**
> "Our AI is trained specifically for estate planning document analysis. We combine large language model capabilities with a rules engine that encodes state-specific legal requirements. For critical issues like the ones we showed, accuracy is very high. We also provide confidence scores and always recommend attorney consultation for any changes."

**Q: Is this legal advice?**
> "No — and that's an important distinction. EstateAI is a document analysis and education tool. We identify potential gaps and explain what we found in plain English. We're not providing legal advice or telling you what to do. For that, you should consult with an attorney — and we make it easy to connect with one."

**Q: What states do you support?**
> "We're launching with California — the largest HNW market with complex trust laws. We'll be adding Texas, Florida, and New York shortly, which together represent about 44% of our target market."

**Q: How is this different from just asking ChatGPT to review my documents?**
> "Three key differences. First, we have a purpose-built rules engine with state-specific legal requirements — something a general-purpose AI doesn't have. Second, we have a structured gap taxonomy based on what estate planning attorneys actually look for. Third, security — we're built for handling sensitive legal documents with encryption, access controls, and compliance measures. You shouldn't be uploading your trust to a general chatbot."

**Q: What's the pricing?**
> "Our comprehensive estate package analysis is $399–$599, depending on complexity. Compare that to $5,000–$15,000 for an attorney to do a full review. We're providing clarity at a fraction of the cost."
