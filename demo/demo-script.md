# EstatePrep: Demo Script

## Presentation Script

---

### Slide 1 (Zeke)

Good afternoon. My name is Zeke, and this is Preston, Keegan, and Colton. We have developed a product that runs gap analysis on documents by estate planning lawyers and their clients.

---

### Slide 2 (Zeke)

Experts recommend updating wills and trusts roughly every three to five years, however a lot can happen during this time.

Lawyers and clients will spend hours talking about what has changed in the clients life, and what documents need to be updated.

This leads to increased costs for clients, and decreased efficiency for firms.

---

### Slide 3 (Zeke)

Probate takes time, leading to a long time after death for beneficiaries not being able to access money, and probate costs money, ranging from three to seven percent of total estate value.

This also matters because many clients logically don't like planning for death, as it is an uncomfortable task.

The more time clients spend with a lawyer managing their documents, the more emotionally draining the process is.

---

### Slide 4 (Keegan)

At a high level, our solution uses AI to analyze existing estate planning documents like wills and trusts.

The goal is not to replace attorneys, but to support them by quickly flagging potential risks, missing elements, or inconsistencies.

What makes this useful is that everything is explained in plain language — so attorneys can review faster, and clients can actually understand what their documents say.

---

### Slide 5 (Preston / Colton)

In Step 1, users upload relevant documents and answer a short questionnaire. This gives the system both structured inputs and real documents to work with.

In Step 2, this is where the AI comes in. The AI analyzes the uploaded documents, extracts key legal and financial information, and summarizes what actually matters — things like ownership, beneficiaries, risks, and missing pieces.

Then in Step 3, users receive a clear score along with actionable insights. Instead of reading dense documents, they immediately understand their situation and what steps to take next.

So overall, the AI acts as the engine that turns complex documents into clear, usable guidance.

---

### Slide 6 (Keegan)

This product is designed primarily for estate planning attorneys and small to mid-sized law firms, where a large portion of work involves reviewing, explaining, and updating estate documents.

These firms often deal with high document volume and clients who don't fully understand what their documents contain.

To show how this works in practice, we'll walk through a short demo using a hypothetical client named Susan.

Susan has the core estate documents in place, but some are outdated and her beneficiary information isn't fully aligned.

---

### Slide 7 (Preston)

In Susan's case, the analysis shows that while her core estate documents are in place, some are outdated and her beneficiary information isn't fully aligned.

That puts her in a middle-range score, with clear areas that need attention but no major red flags.

This gives the attorney a clear, focused starting point for next steps.

---

### Slide 8 (Keegan)

The benefits break down into four main areas.

First, time savings – attorneys spend less time manually reading documents.

Second, higher accuracy – potential issues are flagged automatically, reducing human oversight.

Third, lower costs – firms can handle more work without scaling repetitive labor.

And finally, less confusion for clients, since everything is explained without legal jargon, leading to more confidence and fewer follow-ups.

---

### Slide 9 (Colton)

From a trust and safety perspective, the system is designed with clear guardrails.

The AI assists with analysis but does not make legal decisions — attorneys review and control all final outputs.

Documents are handled privately and stored using secure data practices.

The system also provides transparent outputs, so attorneys can easily verify how conclusions are reached.

This allows firms to gain efficiency while maintaining professional oversight and data security.

---

### Slide 10 (Colton)

We sell the platform directly to law firms, and they offer it to clients as part of estate planning and probate services. We don't sell to consumers — firms are the primary customer.

Pricing is usage-based, so firms only pay for what they actually use, which keeps costs low and adoption friction minimal.

Over time, we expand to firms in additional states and then move up-market to larger practices.

---

### Slide 11 (Colton)

Beyond the core product, there are a few additional features.

The reminder system flags issues based on severity and allows users to opt out, so alerts are helpful without being intrusive.

The platform also generates personalized PDFs using the user's information, which firms can share directly with clients.

Finally, all guidance is adjusted for state-specific requirements, so recommendations align with the user's state of residence.

---

### Slide 12 (Preston)

At this point, the MVP is fully built and functional, and the business plan has been finalized.

We're in active discussions with law firms, and early feedback has been positive — firms have expressed interest and confirmed the product is feasible within their existing workflows.

We're now using those conversations to refine pricing and prepare for broader rollout.

---

### Slide 13 (Zeke)

*Clearer estates. Faster workflows. Better outcomes.*
