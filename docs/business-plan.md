## Problem Statement

### The Estate Planning Gap

**Current Market Reality:**
- Only 24% of American adults have a will or estate plan, a number that has decreased over the years
- Only 36-40% of parents with children under 18 have a will
- Average attorney cost: $1,000-$3,000 for basic estate plan
- DIY online tools often are unsuccessful
- Plans are incomplete and impartial

**Why People Don't Plan:**
1. **Cost** - Attorney fees too expensive are prohibitive for most households
2. **Complexity** - Legal jargon and forms are intimidating; estate planning requires unfamiliar concepts
3. **Time** - Large time commitment; multiple meetings, paperwork, back-and-forth
4. **Procrastination** - Easy to postpone until a later time
5. **Uniformity** - Existing tools don't adapt to individual situations; life changes break plans quickly

**Existing Document Problem:**
- A significant majority of Americans have outdated wills/trusts
- Life changes (marriage, children, divorce, death, new assets) require updates
- Full document rewrites are expensive and often unnecessary
- No affordable way to get targeted, specific updates
