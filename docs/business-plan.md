# EstateAI: Opportunity Refinement Brief

## Executive Summary

EstateAI is an AI-powered estate plan analysis platform targeting high-net-worth individuals with $2M–$50M in assets. Our primary value proposition is **gap analysis**—helping users identify faults, risks, and missing provisions in their existing wills and trusts, delivering professional-grade insights at a fraction of traditional legal costs.

**Mission Statement:**
Our company empowers individuals to fully understand, optimize, and confidently manage their estate plans by providing highly personalized, intelligent document analysis. We transform complex wills, trusts, and estate documents into clear, actionable insights that highlight potential gaps, inconsistencies, or outdated provisions.

This segment represents a strategic sweet spot: complex enough to require sophisticated analysis, but underserved by traditional legal services that are either too basic (DIY tools) or too expensive (white-glove law firms).

---

## Problem Statement

### The High-Net-Worth Estate Planning Gap

**Market Reality:**
- Individuals with $2M–$50M in assets have meaningful estate planning complexity
- They typically have existing plans—but those plans often contain gaps, outdated provisions, or compliance issues
- Traditional legal review costs $300–$600/hour, making regular check-ups prohibitively expensive
- Life changes (marriage, divorce, children, asset acquisitions) create "plan drift" over time

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**

| Solution | Problem for $2M–$50M Segment |
|----------|------------------------------|
| **DIY tools** (LegalZoom, etc.) | Too basic; don't handle trusts, multi-asset complexity |
| **Traditional attorneys** | Expensive ($5,000–$15,000 for comprehensive review); slow; unclear pricing |
| **Family offices** | Only economical above $50M–$100M |
| **Financial advisors** | Not qualified to provide legal document analysis |

**Key Insight: "There is no single estate plan — there is a document ecosystem"**

Outcomes are governed by (in priority order):
1. Asset title
2. Beneficiary forms
3. Trust instruments
4. Contracts
5. Wills
6. State default law

**"Most estate failures occur not because documents are missing, but because they conflict"**

## Solution Overview

### Core Value Proposition

**"Professional-grade estate plan analysis, powered by AI, at a fraction of traditional legal costs."**

### Key Features

- **Advanced document parsing and targeted gap analysis**
- **Scenario-based hypothetical questions** reflecting real-life situations
- **Tax minimization and probate avoidance recommendations**

2. **Outdated Elements**
   - Deceased or estranged executors/trustees
   - Pre-divorce beneficiary designations
   - Old asset references

3. **State Compliance Issues**
   - Witness/notary requirements not met
   - Invalid provisions under current state law
   - Missing statutory language

4. **Structural Risks**
   - Unfunded trusts
   - Probate exposure
   - Tax inefficiency opportunities

5. **Coordination Gaps**
   - Beneficiary designation conflicts
   - Will-trust inconsistencies
   - POA/healthcare proxy gaps
