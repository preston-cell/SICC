# EstateAI: Opportunity Refinement Brief

## Executive Summary

EstateAI is an AI-powered estate plan analysis platform targeting high-net-worth individuals with $2M–$50M in assets. Our primary value proposition is **gap analysis**—helping users identify faults, risks, and missing provisions in their existing wills and trusts, delivering professional-grade insights at a fraction of traditional legal costs.

This segment represents a strategic sweet spot: complex enough to require sophisticated analysis, but underserved by traditional legal services that are either too basic (DIY tools) or too expensive (white-glove law firms).

---

## Problem Statement

### The High-Net-Worth Estate Planning Gap

**Market Reality:**
- Individuals with $2M–$50M in assets have meaningful estate planning complexity
- They typically have existing plans—but those plans often contain gaps, outdated provisions, or compliance issues
- Traditional legal review costs $300–$600/hour, making regular check-ups prohibitively expensive
- Life changes (marriage, divorce, children, asset acquisitions) create "plan drift" over time

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**

| Solution | Problem for $2M–$50M Segment |
|----------|------------------------------|
| **DIY tools** (LegalZoom, etc.) | Too basic; don't handle trusts, multi-asset complexity |
| **Traditional attorneys** | Expensive ($5,000–$15,000 for comprehensive review); slow; unclear pricing |
| **Family offices** | Only economical above $50M–$100M |
| **Financial advisors** | Not qualified to provide legal document analysis |

**The "Drift" Problem:**
- Estate plans are living documents that should evolve with life circumstances
- Most plans are created once and never reviewed
- Hidden gaps create risk: unintended disinheritance, tax inefficiency, probate exposure
- Clients don't know what they don't know

## Solution Overview

### Core Value Proposition

**"Professional-grade estate plan analysis, powered by AI, at a fraction of traditional legal costs."**

### Primary Capability: Gap Analysis

Our platform analyzes existing estate planning documents to identify:

1. **Missing Provisions**
   - No digital asset clause
   - Missing contingent beneficiaries
   - Absent incapacity planning

2. **Outdated Elements**
   - Deceased or estranged executors/trustees
   - Pre-divorce beneficiary designations
   - Old asset references

3. **State Compliance Issues**
   - Witness/notary requirements not met
   - Invalid provisions under current state law
   - Missing statutory language

4. **Structural Risks**
   - Unfunded trusts
   - Probate exposure
   - Tax inefficiency opportunities

5. **Coordination Gaps**
   - Beneficiary designation conflicts
   - Will-trust inconsistencies
   - POA/healthcare proxy gaps

## Why $2M–$50M Is the Optimal Segment

### Below $2M: Simple Needs

Individuals with <$2M typically have straightforward estates:
- Primary residence (passes via deed or TOD)
- Retirement accounts (pass via beneficiary designation)
- Basic will covers residual

**DIY tools work adequately. Our solution is overbuilt for their needs.**

### Above $50M: Ultra-High-Net-Worth (UHNW) Complexity

Individuals with >$50M typically require:
- Dynasty trusts
- Multi-generational planning
- Family office infrastructure
- Multi-jurisdiction tax optimization
- Ongoing legal and financial teams

**They demand white-glove human services and are willing to pay for them. AI is a supplement, not a solution.**

### $2M–$50M: The Underserved Sweet Spot

| Factor | Why It Favors AI Solution |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Complexity** | Real trust/estate structure complexity that DIY can't handle |
| **Cost sensitivity** | Not willing to pay $15K+ for comprehensive legal review |
| **Existing plans** | Already have documents—need analysis, not creation |
| **Time constraints** | Busy professionals who value efficiency |
| **Tech comfort** | Generally comfortable with digital tools |
| **Scale** | ~8–10 million US households in this range |
