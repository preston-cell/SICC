# EstateAI: Research Notes

## Key Insights to Embed

### Core Philosophy

1. **"There is no single estate plan — there is a document ecosystem"**
   - Estate planning involves multiple interconnected documents
   - Each document serves a specific purpose
   - Documents must work together cohesively

2. **Outcome Priority Order**
   Outcomes are governed by (in this order):
   1. Asset title
   2. Beneficiary forms
   3. Trust instruments
   4. Contracts
   5. Wills
   6. State default law

3. **"Most estate failures occur not because documents are missing, but because they conflict"**
   - Will vs. trust inconsistencies
   - Beneficiary designations vs. will provisions
   - POA vs. trust provisions
   - Joint ownership vs. will directions

4. **Estate Planning Risk Progression (Step-Function)**
   - **Incapacity risk** → POA, Healthcare Proxy
   - **Probate inefficiency** → Trusts, TOD designations
   - **Behavioral risk** → Spendthrift provisions, trustee selection
   - **Tax risk** → Tax planning trusts, exemption planning
   - **Governance risk** → Family governance, professional trustees

5. **"If the state default result is unacceptable, a document is required"**
   - State intestacy laws govern without a will
   - State POA rules apply without a document
   - If default outcomes don't match wishes, action needed

## High-Net-Worth ($2M–$50M) Behavioral Research

### HNW Estate Planning Behavior Patterns

#### Key Findings from Wealth Research

1. **High Plan Ownership, Low Plan Maintenance**
   - ~70% of HNW households have some form of estate plan
   - Only ~25% have reviewed their plan in the past 3 years
   - Average plan age: 7–10 years
   - Most plans are "set and forget"

2. **Trigger Events Drive Action**
   - Major life events prompt estate planning activity:
     - Death of parent/spouse (highest trigger)
     - Marriage/divorce/remarriage
     - Birth of child/grandchild
     - Major asset acquisition (home, business)
     - Health scare
   - Market events occasionally trigger reviews

3. **Cost-Benefit Calculation**
   - HNW individuals understand the need for professional help
   - BUT: Struggle to justify $5,000–$15,000 for comprehensive review
   - Often perceive attorney fees as opaque and unpredictable
   - Want to know "what specifically needs fixing" before engaging

4. **Relationship Dependency**
   - Many HNW individuals had a trusted attorney relationship
   - Relationship often lapses (attorney retires, moves, dies)
   - Starting with a new attorney feels daunting
   - Creates "orphaned" estate plans

#### HNW Digital Behavior

| Behavior | HNW Adoption |
|----------|--------------|
| Online banking | 95%+ |
| Investment apps | 75%+ |
| Tax software | 60% |
| Legal tech (any) | 25–35% |
| Estate planning tools | <15% |

**Insight:** HNW individuals are digitally comfortable but haven't embraced legal tech for estate planning. Opportunity for a well-positioned solution.

### Common Conflict Patterns

| Conflict Type | Example | Impact |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| **Beneficiary vs. Will** | IRA names ex-spouse; will leaves to children | Ex-spouse gets IRA |
| **Title vs. Trust** | House titled individually; trust says goes to charity | House goes through probate to will beneficiaries |
| **Contract vs. Will** | Buy-sell mandates sale to partner; will leaves to spouse | Partner gets business |
| **Joint vs. Will** | Joint account with child; will divides equally | Joint owner gets account |

## Legal Research

### Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL) Considerations

#### Key Distinctions for Gap Analysis Product

1. **Document Preparation vs. Analysis**
   - Document preparation = creating legal documents (higher UPL risk)
   - Document analysis = reviewing existing documents for issues (lower UPL risk)
   - Our focus on analysis positions us more safely

2. **Legal Advice vs. Legal Information**
   - Legal advice = recommending specific actions for specific situations (UPL)
   - Legal information = explaining what documents say, identifying gaps (not UPL)
   - We provide information and education, not advice

3. **Technology Intermediary Doctrine**
   - Software that assists users in understanding documents ≠ UPL
   - Key: User makes decisions; tool provides information
   - Precedent: TurboTax, LegalZoom (in most states)

#### State-Specific Considerations

| State | UPL Risk Level | Key Requirements |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Massachusetts | Low-Medium | Clear disclaimers; no specific legal advice |
| New York | Medium | Active bar; strong disclaimers needed |
| California | Low-Medium | LDA registration may be required for document prep; analysis likely exempt |
| Florida | Medium | More restrictive; careful positioning required |

#### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Clear Disclaimers**
   - "This is not legal advice"
   - "Results are for informational purposes only"
   - "Consult an attorney before taking action"

2. **Positioning**
   - "Educational tool" not "legal service"
   - "Gap identification" not "legal recommendations"
   - "Analysis report" not "legal opinion"

3. **Attorney Referral Integration**
   - Recommend attorney consultation for all action items
   - Build attorney referral network
   - Creates clear handoff point

4. **User Acknowledgments**
   - Terms of service clearly state limitations
   - User confirms understanding before analysis
   - No attorney-client relationship formed

## Technology Research

### LLM Capabilities for Estate Plan Analysis

#### Tested Capabilities (Using Claude)

| Task | Quality | Confidence | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| Document parsing | Very Good | High | Extracts structure, names, provisions |
| Element identification | Very Good | High | Executors, trustees, beneficiaries |
| Gap detection | Good | Medium | Identifies missing provisions |
| State rule compliance | Variable | Medium | Needs rules engine support |
| Risk assessment | Good | Medium | Can explain severity |
| Plain-English summary | Excellent | High | Clear explanations |

#### Key Technical Findings

1. **LLMs excel at:**
   - Understanding document structure
   - Extracting named entities (people, assets)
   - Explaining legal provisions in plain language
   - Identifying obvious gaps and inconsistencies

2. **LLMs need support for:**
   - State-specific statutory requirements (rules engine)

   - Precision on numbers/dates (validation layer)

3. **Hybrid Architecture Required:**
   - LLM for document understanding and explanation

### Document Parsing Research

#### HNW Document Complexity

Typical HNW estate plan includes:
- Revocable Living Trust (15–50 pages)
- Pour-over Will (5–10 pages)
- Durable Power of Attorney (5–10 pages)
- Healthcare Proxy/Advance Directive (3–5 pages)
- Trust amendments (variable)
- Beneficiary designations (separate from documents)

**Total:** 30–80+ pages across multiple documents

#### Parsing Challenges

1. **Attorney-drafted documents vary widely**
   - Different formatting conventions
   - Different clause structures
   - Different terminology

2. **Scanned vs. native PDFs**
   - Many documents are scanned
   - OCR quality varies
   - Handwritten notes/signatures

3. **Multi-document coordination**
   - Will-trust consistency

   - Amendment integration

#### Recommended Approach

1. **Document upload**: PyMuPDF + OCR fallback
2. **Text extraction**: Preserve structure where possible
3. **LLM parsing**: Extract key elements into structured data
4. **Rules validation**: Check against state requirements
5. **Gap identification**: Compare to best practices checklist

> "My biggest fear is that I've got something set up wrong and my kids are going to have a nightmare when I die."

> "If I could get a report that tells me exactly what needs fixing, I'd pay a few hundred dollars for that easily. It's the open-ended attorney engagement that scares me."

2. **Cost anxiety** — Afraid of open-ended legal fees
3. **Relationship gap** — No trusted attorney relationship
