## Comparison: Why NOT Other Segments?

### Below $2M: Limited Value Proposition

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **Asset complexity** | Low — typically 2–3 assets |
| **Estate planning needs** | Basic — beneficiary designations, simple will |
| **Existing solutions** | Adequate — LegalZoom, free templates work |
| **Price sensitivity** | Very high — won't pay $300+ for analysis |
| **Our value-add** | Minimal — overbuilt for their needs |

**Conclusion:** Market is large but low-value. CAC would exceed LTV.

### Above $50M: Human Services Preferred

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **Asset complexity** | Extreme — dynasty trusts, family offices, multi-jurisdiction |
| **Estate planning needs** | Ongoing — requires dedicated legal team |
| **Existing solutions** | White-glove law firms, family offices |
| **Price sensitivity** | Low — willing to pay $50K+ annually |
| **Our value-add** | Supplementary at best |

**Conclusion:** AI is a tool for their advisors, not a direct service to them.
